Sorry for not writing to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excute !
I am looking forward to our meeting .
There has been change relatinships between people .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc .
When the government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually apply control over them .
This technology could also be seen as an invasion of human 's privacy .
The initial function is good indeed that to track the movement of them to protect the public safety and interest if they are out of prison .
The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 1900 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .
However , during the process of making development to our life , we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of sources allocation can also be slowed down .
Thanks to modern technology , I enjoy chatting with my friend in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day .
Regarding your advertisement , it is the LONDON 'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW , but I was deeply disappointed at it .
I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager .
This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution .
During work , the supervisor usually asks the so called " old staff ' to lead the newbie .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take money with me .
Dear Mrs. Mrs. ,
That is to say , they are never happy with what they get and see .
Dear Madam :
I hope to hear from you later on .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology .
When all the money was gone from a bank , nobody was there except for Pat .
Maybe , it is because modern society is becoming more and more competitive , the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
The girl sold the tickets were laughing at me when I mentioned the discounts availability was written in the advertisement .
Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country .
This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking .
Yours sincerely,
Danny Brook is one of my favorite actors and was playing another one .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , we would like to ask you if it is possible to make some changes in the programme ?
I can not believe that I won the first prize ( It 's great ! )
We thought , as usual we do in London theatre , we could have discounts as it 's written on your advertisement .
Dear Mr. Robertson
Yours faithfully,
In most countries , healthcare is provided freely from the government .
Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
Lo Son Lin .
Everyone told us it was a breath taking .
Maybe for women , but not for me .
Then if his house got stolen , perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back .
Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event .
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get used to this living <unk> <unk> under a microscope '' .
I think in the future home might just be the place to go to sleep .
But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one .
Could you do me half of the money back ?
Our question now : Could we go to this show ?
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON A <unk> E-STYLE , PERSONALITY AND NEEDS .
Anyway it was so interesting that I did n't even feel tired after that .
It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
We pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that are n't money , success , and power .
Take care !
I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie .
It was great to hear from you , have n't seen you since last summer holiday , hope everything is fine in your place .
In conclusion , rising life expectancies is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development .
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
To finish my <unk> <unk> marvelous '' evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
It is believed that our life style has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc .
Despite the challenges from ageing population , it is an achievement as less people are in competency to bid for one job position .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
In my opinion , modern technology makes our life style more flexible .
What should be concerned is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way .
Finally , I was wondering if some special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip ?
The trip that you planned for us , students , it 's a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city like London .
It was my favorite play .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
He did not play in the evening .
To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed .
I explained to him where the street was that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while .
Love
First of all , people might think more about the function of clothes than the design .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people 's lives .
As an overall , the rising life expectancies can be considered as a pro and con to the country .
I look forward to hearing from you .
How has modern technology changed our daily life ?
How much do you recommend me to bring with me ?
We hope to change the excursion program a little will not cause any problems .
Before people find another planet to live , the earth is the only habitat for us , and hence the limit of its capacity to support living , it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live .
It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth .
No evidence is recorded .
13th June , 2000
There are millions of doctors all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .
Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never been there before .
I have some questions as follows :
We do n't even spend time with our families .
In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staff this evening ! !
I felt regret but it was n't a secret any more now .
For example , in the time of our visit there is going to be <unk> <unk> The London Fashion and Leisure Show '' .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to commit suicide without causing trouble to others .
The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public .
If you have to run from one shop to another and always looking at the watch , doing shopping is a terrible activity .
First of all , I am a student and would like to travel in July .
You wanted to cheat me , so I would be very pleased if you could give my money back .
Especially week-ends .
The area for parking , space for play grown to the children or bus stations near the mall are not really appropriate .
I did n't have the 'perfect evening out ' you 'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible .
Yours sincerely ,
However , the chip implant can be retrieved easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag .
It is the outcome of advanced medical technology , changing of lifestyle and higher living standard .
As long as the regulations of using that are obeyed , surveillance technology can serve as a good tool .
And once this happens , privacy does not exist any more and people 's lives are under great threat .
My wife Catrin is a local master of swimming .
But shopping is not always enjoyable .
About camp activities I would prefer to do basketball and photography .
We are all very friendly in our class and we help each other when we have a problem .
Introduction
If somebody is a film star this means that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .
First of all , now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
He was so amazed and asked to repeat it .
To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency .
People 's lifetime rise means that the time of the cycle of generation rises .
One can also easily see his deeply loved one through the internet from miles away .
To : Mr Ted
When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife , none of the couple wants it to be heard by the people behind the monitors .
Some rules are really simple : we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during the classes .
And , I forgot to say about the actor , I did n't enjoy them .
Manela B .
Because I intend to take the examination in September .
The strange thing happened to me when I got back to that man .
In golf , we are both total beginners .
I look forward to your letter .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
According to the advertisement you gave , there have been some important differences .
For example , they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but did n't pay attention to the child , so that this kind of agency may bring the child to the mountain area and sell him or her with a good price .
Contrary to the advertisement , everything was disapointing .
Development of technology is making our lives easier and more comfortable .
Wawsaw , December 12th , 2000
In history , there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs , such as the Nazi Germany , the Soveit Union .
I AM WRITING YOU WITH REFERENCE IN THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE HAVING PRERY SOON .
Awful .
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price .
Also , I would like to join basketball team , I used to play basketball when I was in high school , and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during last ten years in our city .
By investigating the track by the surveillance technology , they can easily figure out where their kids are now and know roughly what they are doing .
Their opinions are found on the basic human rights .
As soon as the arrangement for the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend .
I have a friend , his name Peter , he is my best friend .
Knowing that this is the favorable route by the people , the government now has sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefits the people .
Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves .
In reference about the date of the travel , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at the University and I only have July to take my holidays .
Please apologise to me , but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made , which disappointed me very .
In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , although global aging issue has become more serious on human development , if we can balance and understand why we live .
Is it very hot ?
Before I came England , I swam every weekend in my country even in winter , so I chose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp .
Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual 's existence on earth .
Both computers and Internet influence people 's lives .
Without life , we have nothing .
Besides , this show is a gree ( another positiu point ) .
I am sure you can understand my disappointment .
Yours sincerely,
It was such a great experience !
Trends of the highly emotionally and easily manipulated humans can be tracked , analysis , archived and chronicled .
I 'm writing to you as regardthe letter you sent me about the competition I 've won .
Finally , I would be grateful if you could answer me soon .
What a surprise it was to get a letter from you after all this time .
There are a series of diseases that hinders longevity .
Secondly , the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
Then , I had read that there would be discounts available , but it was n't true !
Yours sincerely K .
I am very keen on photography .
I start thinking what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something apropiate does n't matter how much money does it cost .
For example , UPS can track the process of each delivery .
It really happened in China .
Yours sincerely,
Finally the sentence was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true .
According to news , the police force had mobilized thousands of cops , each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months , none of them were able to find Matt Selamat and rearrested him .
We will be learning at home using computers and disc .
Eliza Vasquez .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes are at .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people 's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
I am especially great last weekend in the concert of Backstreet Boys .
Dear Sir Madam ,
For developed countries , the challenge they face mainly are the over crowded modern cities usually face public transportation problems and also the unevenly distributed wealth which result in that some of the population unable to benefit from the development of human society in terms of technology which improve the quality of life .
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting program .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
!
But why ?
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions .
In that case , if they get lost or lose contact , they will be considered as lost and eventually , they will not survive .
Reality kills people in mind .
After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence , police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence .
We were only waiting for Agatha who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend .
There is a truth that we can not deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machines are more honest than people .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays .
On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police .
It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , the labor is considered to become less and each labor needs to pay more on the welfare of the old people .
However , this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates of a nation 's provision of quality healthcare benefits and living for senior citizens .
Average life span rise from 45 years old in 1920s to over 65 years old in 2010s .
Besides , we can try to reduce the bad effects caused by the new technology .
He just moved his nose !
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Enyway the disco was great , and the music also .
I hope you will consider this matter .
I would like to travel in July .
However this term has been a far cry from others .
Hello !
One day , Peter killed one boy .
In my opinion , doing shopping brings me a lot of satisfaction , especially when I am depressed , nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp .
In general , surveillance technology benefits society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals ' lives .
Besides illness , the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and quality .
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
Dear Mr. or Madam , ( Dear Mr. Madam )
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
In transportation , almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transportation .
In addition , the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family .
In such a situation , society can develop a harmonious and healthy way .
One day , when Maria was sitting in her bedroom , someone knocked on the door , it was Manuel , he was worried about her .
There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work .
So we can do shopping instead .
It is useful as it reduces the chances of wrong doings that may occur .
It has been quite a long time since someone raises the importance of the right of privacy .
We can get some information more quickly .
I personally stand together with the population who rejected the proposal .
It is a very hard thing to predict .
People do not know how to protect their teeth from becoming decayed teeth .
RFID is also functional in police events .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
What is more , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
It was a very exciting moment and a very nice competition .
In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins .
I am letting down because of your behaviour .
This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist the law enforcers such as the police to collect evidence of crime after it occurred .
The increasing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy .
For me was this aventure one of the Best .
Thank you for everything .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Moreover , you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
This phenomenon increases the demand of land property and subsequently affects their price and size together .
But I finally got around writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely worth waiting as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
What a surprise !
Finally let me know what kind of clothes will be the most suitable thing at camp .
However , disadvantages have also been gradually disappearing as with the fruits people are enjoying .
Anni .
Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis .
With the development of technology , we have a more advanced method to track people in today 's society .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
Once cancers are too late to be discovered , one is deemed to death at a later stage .
Would you give me some information about clothes to wear there ?
But at the end of the day it always will be place to go !
I 'm going to help them again .
I really wished to have a friend who can share everything is going in our lives .
On the other hand , people demand a better quality service and advanced technology such as the newer I-Pad model .
I was thinking 'What should I do ? '
I wish that you can provide a better service next time , and this time you need give back the money we paid .
Life is more enjoyable for young adults .
In conclusion , most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depends on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in please .
The ones I 'm most keen on are Tennis , in which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and Painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems .
The main actor was an unknown actor .
Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects , I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it .
After 3 weeks , Maria got ill so she was not available to go to school .
Please help me to disturb .
Write to you next time .
To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year .
Thus , the rising expectancies actually reflect the increasing stability and comfort of people 's lives and indirectly reflecting the ability of government to provide people of their current comforts , economical statues , convenience and others .
Because there was a man who had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him .
Fewer famines , better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century 's greatest achievement as a global society .
The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
Rising life expectancy can be a challenge .
I was writing as reply to your letter , I am glad to have won first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
The ability to eliminate the illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical ability to solve and eliminate the harm that is able to take the life of a human away at a earlier age .
One of the basic rights of humans is the right for privacy .
If one company really uses this technology to track their employees , employees will dislike and claim that their humans ' right and privacy have been violated .
Thanks a lot for your writing .
But everyone always noticed that he had secrets from his face .
At the same time , people must protect their privacy without sharing their place with strangers .
However , there was a different unknown actor in that .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people 's lives more convenient and reliable .
They can live a happy life , but actually to society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Where could they be ?
Mischief cases could actually cause chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally .
The chip identifies technology can be reproduced by anyone .
Dear Kim
When Thomas Adison invented an electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that century .
On the other hand if you can walk without any problems with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable .
My job was to leave some leaflets at shops , restaurants and streets .
I 've never been camping before , I guess I 'm not an outdoor girl , but I 'd like to give it a try , so I 'd rather tents than cabins .
It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie , and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation , just like what was shown in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world , broadcast to billions of people .
Recently , many cell phones are equipped with GPS which means that they can find the device 's location if it is lost .
Today , however , people do not need to spend much time on making food , washing up , or even on turning on an off the light .
This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country .
4 .
Yours faithfully,
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illnesses .
I hope in your answer and in your explanation about this .
Now , I will answer your requests .
Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Please let me know if you need more information .
What did you feel ?
In countries like Singapore , manpower is the only natural resources available which Singapore can invest as she does not have enough land to build farms and factories .
It will be my first time to experience staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
This technology is encouraged by some of the public that implant the RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
As for the future , who knows ?
Every word people can be heard by the government and because of that , the government knows well about everyone 's mind and wants to wash everyone 's mind and control normal people totally .
Camp California in the U.S.A .
Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long .
People expect more on the ground of their current economy , life stability and desire .
If somebody wants to be famous of course must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
Nowadays , the pressure from the head of a company towards those employees caused that people have to be fully concentrated in their jobs and because of that , people start to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement .
Therefore the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is a huge challenge .
In work places , electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporation .
It does n't matter what kind of career or job you are following .
Love , and
Alverio
First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had such a good time in my life !
However , as the life expectancy of people rises , the population aging problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon .
It started a week before that day .
All in all , the RFID system is used to catch the information of the object and track .
Only when there is a ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can the aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor , people rely on the skills of treatment of doctors and hence , they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health .
Yours faithfully,
I also told her to keep a secret that she did n't tell anyone in class .
What I really enjoyed was part of the staff .
I 'm looking forward to hearing your impressions about this !
Thus , rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government 's well-planned or managed schemes .
People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .
How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are requested
She said that I had to be strong and did n't care about them .
Dear Sir Madam ,
They are not contradicting with each other .
When her best friend Scala , asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she 's pregnant , Pat put her feet in the plate just before Scala 's husband got the surprise .
The achievement is some kind of a comparison with history in the past .
Rising life expectancies is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement .
On the other hand , the rising life expectancy can also be an indication , though not entirely , of a country 's reputation to their citizens .
There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films .
A few days later I told her about my secret love story , it became a top gossip among my classmate .
Faithfully ,
If RFID comes into existence , this kind of cases can be totally avoided in no time .
Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter .
This choice does n't give many artists the possibility to express themselves .
There are some machines which have helped in my development , and others which help me to make my life easier .
He asked me if there was a cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was .
It is well-known statistics that , generally , as a country develops the life expectancies increases .
Technology has a huge effect on our spare time activities as well .
In this way , you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing in the same way you'r changing , too .
The unconected part of We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this are money .
After the invention of phone and internet , there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even track people .
She 's a secretary at an office .
People 's average age has become longer compared to the past .
There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world .
From : Meng
Sometimes you can find a bargain .
I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July .
It basically served to allocate your iphone 's position at any single time , For instance , if someone left his phone in a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends ' device .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
Yours faithfully,
Overmore when I send an e-mail , I do n't need to worry about the time .
I would like to go in July I do n't mind wich two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family .
THAT NIGHT I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly. You ca n't have it .
Actually , this technology has already been weaved into our life .
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance .
In addition , retirement is a must in some countries .
Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size .
I have just received your letter , and thank you very much for your reply .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output .
To summary , we respect every life , and also help people live longer .
Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook .
Dear Madam
The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
Famous people are living creatures .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to society can not be neglected anymore .
I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is .
They may die for hunger , die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never woke up again .
I am going to finish my exams in June , and I am planning to go back to China in early August .
We are on the right track .
In one way the surveillance helps the government guard the civilians ' property and life , in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours ' monitoring .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) has been made possible to track people by implanting certain markers on people or products .
On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed .
There are also medical tools that are more implant into the human body for the basic medical research .
Dear Mr. RR,
The place we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days setting up the stage , the equitment , and the lights .
We had to adjust the laser extremly in the correct position .
To Mr Robertson
I think that this programme has a good organization , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .
It is like a key that opens up the gate of a human body defend system and provides a cleared path for other diseases to attack in .
Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime .
As the aging population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age .
I TOLD HIM and DID N'T KNOW WHERE I WAS BUT HE JUST SEID SORRY .
Among these basic rights , the most important one is the right to live .
Regarding the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months .
Then , the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone there before .
What kind of clothes are needed ?
Although the initial function of implementation of RFID is good for the children , however children also have the human rights and privacy which is endanger under this technology .
We talked about the first possibility .
The people who are on the run from the mafia will be at risk !
And Mrs Helen , I would really appreciate if you send me back a letter with all the answers of my question , anyway .
However , since the space and resource on earth is very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
It is wonderful for me to have the opportunity to visit the Camp California in the U.S.A .
IN MY OPINION , PEOPLE WILL GIVE IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITY DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
This would result in the losing of manpower in a country .
The government is supposed to serve the people .
I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .
I hope you 'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show , you should return my money .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and an extremely aggressive .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ASPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED , LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HIPERMARKETS AND DISSHUTERS .
Moreover , the life expectancies have also been raised due to the development of the economy .
Although , the accommodation is n't so important to me .
In recents decedes , it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life .
From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
I was looking for a special fruit .
Not only the details of location will be provided , but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen in any family .
Anyway , I had a lot of fun working for them .
It may lead a shorter way to the decision and provide more sales and revenue for the company .
In response to your letter .
It monitors anybody 's movement or activity , and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law , etc .
Apart from diseases themselves , deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer .
While we are using technology , we should take into consideration the environment .
Thus there will be a lack in labor force , which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country .
It is not only scary but also illegal .
Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to tell you the information you have requested .
So I can only afford to go on holiday in July .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data based for various uses .
In the winter we are to change our shoes .
Furthermore , I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team in the football field as it is completely new and full equiped .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground .
If you do n't find anything good enough for you do n't worry , you should always remember : It 's not all about the money !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but anyway I trusted him .
Home sweet home .
Two weeks in California in the USA is the thing about I dreamed a lot .
All the achievements human make influence on the lifespan of people .
They will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing to their whole working career .
However , the rising of life expectancy is also a challenge to the entire human nation .
I also would like to claim some refund for the evening .
<unk> <unk> Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
There was a saying that says that hunger can bring people back to animals .
It is a challenge where this illness ca n't be easily avoided by any person in such a stressful lifestyle in any place in the world .
I miss Peter very much , it 's unfair to put him in a prison .
If this piece of information is misused , chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer .
For example , one would like to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she will expect it to have more functions or operate faster after using it for a while .
As state in your letter I have to choose the accommodation type .
As I told you in my last letter , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them at a concert in Barcelona .
But , I 've got it though .
And you can see their clothes also .
Firstly , I would like to give you some details about this show .
Yours sincerely,
As I am an enthusiasmic of musicals I went to see this musical show .
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY HOW TO DO IT .
From my point of view , I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security .
That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise .
MAY 29 , 1997 .
To sum up modern technology has changed a lot our daily life and this is going to increase .
For the logistics , if all the products are attached to the tags , it is much easier to count and record all the products .
So you have to complain about it .
Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies , it is challenging also can get some achievement .
Yours sincerely,
Machines , such as a dish washer , laundry machine and remote controller help us just to relax or do a little work necessary .
The whole class is also very exciting about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go .
Dear Mr. Robertson
It is convenient for customers to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .
Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be a brilliant memory .
The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation , better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the liar .
If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in line all night .
Yours faithfully,
Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happen in many developing countries .
How are you ?
Japan society is now facing a severe aging problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
On the other hand , the achievement perceiving is to make comparisons in the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation in the past .
For the young people , parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after school .
In another a word , people will feel that the boss or the company treat them like goods , because modern people need more homage not money .
Then , in the program I could read a discount available for the tickets , for the groups , but I could n't .
It was the happiest moment of my life .
With advanced medical technology , not only many diseases can be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
Dear Friend,
One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills , all you need is a lot of patience .
Definitely , there are points of view that agree with the technology but also the voices of objection .
And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .
On one side , we can not deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies .
The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compared to the population 's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future .
Nights in the War. ( I think this is what you mean )
It is a challenge but also an achievement .
Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops .
Yours sincerely,
And of course , the time to pay .
I sometimes have trouble with backache when I ca n't sleep on a flat ground .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know further information about travel and accomodation .
All the moves of us are closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of the homes .
Last month , I was partly in the concert teams .
Once again congratulations on the Festival .
A few years ago , there was a jailbreaker named Matt Selamat , one of the members of the terrorists of Osama , successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore .
Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer .
Since it is read-only , the card can not protect itself .
The observation means that the more developed countries , the longer life span of citizens .
With the strong back support of technology , the rise of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society .
By the way , I have n't seen Pat about one year .
Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
And finally I would like to ask you some questions .
My duties like a organization member were diferent , the first day I had to pick the bands up at the airport , for it I hired a van .
He was trying to speak in Spanish , but his accent was terrible .
Furthermore , some parents hold the positive views to surveillance technology and agree to implant the RFID into their children 's body .
Also people begin to realize the importance of the environment , how to protect people from the harmful air .
I am looking forward to the answer !
We should separate it into two aspects .
As we know that population of human continues in the growth year by year , we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life , for example , the oil , people 's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil .
In conclusion , it is delightful to observe the fact that life expectancies are rising , but one must have the idea in mind that rising life expectancies is never easy .
I need extra money ?
In my opinion , the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family , so for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
Recommendation
More challenges also include the environment challenges that are seen over the years .
However , these natural resources are not renewable .
For instance , a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget throughout my life .
Normally , people will regard extended life expectation as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries .
To our disappointment , now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources .
Fashion in 100 years
The second life expectancy is increased in medical technology and sources .
Working long hours , doing plenty of activieties , going out , going on holidays .
The next consideration is the activities .
This significantly raised people 's average life expectancy .
By taking an example in any country , there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits had been arrested and being punished .
These are some points I want to mention about the differences between the advertisement said and the realities .
It is natural that rising life expectancy is regarded as an achievement .
Maybe some people are nakid .
In some kindergartens , the RFID is used to tab children to keep records of their attendance and whereabouts .
On Thursday , the 3rd of May 2000 , we went to your theatre to see <unk> <unk> Over the rainbow '' .
The reasons I am really writing , however , is to give you some details of my trip to California .
There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that are acquired by kidnappers .
I also hope that the festival will be even better next year .
Because of the surveillance technology , more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used .
And nowadays , I have been practicing tennis as a school activity .
Recently , a new surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people .
The very about young people , the choice to offer a reasonable priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .
Write me as soon as you can .
With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID , spy on the population can be much easier , which will create even worse scenery for the citizens .
I am so glad .
I was so disappointed with that .
Life expectancies rise significantly from the past to recent in the whole world .
However , if nothing happened inside his house , then the surveillance becomes useless , and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised .
I 'm writing you in complain about a musical show that I have visited last evening .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Love
For example , the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner .
The number and types of illness also increases relative to age too .
We did n't have as many machines as they had .
It depends on what you need .
Their opinion is based on the children 's safety protection and parents ' guardian .
There were some stories I never told anyone before , but I had share with her all my secrets .
I must say that rules are n't the same in the schools of our country .
So , it would be greatful if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
because of these changes all my opinions about self-important behavior of a superstar .
for my accommodation .
Life expectancy can be defined as a desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .
Moreover , all about the make up and the hairstyles .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
We were a stedy at the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
To be honest , I wanted to share this feeling with someone else but I needed to keep a very secret .
It was 45 minutes later than it supposed to be .
In fact , people are getting more exposed to public through the fast development of the virtual world the internet .
I 've been recently seeing your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening !
I think that the most important modern technology these days is the internet .
Now I am going to give you some further information I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in High school and this is most important year of my life I am studying to university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then by the end of June I will be having university entrance exam after that in July I am going to be alright .
Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops .
Best wishes
Without such surveillance technology , we can still live a better future .
Regarding your letter dated on the 6th of June I 'm so happy to receive the first price .
Every school has its own rules .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Even though we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never .
Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes .
Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .
And another question is what is the prices of things like in there , so that I can make a better buget on my trip .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that the overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
One of the reasons for visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participance .
For instance , reading , looking for information or using the computer .
In fact , these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past .
I look forward to your reply .
It was terrible .
Is there any toilet or shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby ?
I regret not paying all my expenses .
It 's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities .
Yours sincerely,
Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now .
Yours sincerely,
Also the tents are not fairly comfortable .
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL SHOW THAT IS TAKING PART IN THE CIRCLE THEATRE .
Yours truly,
For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I 'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000 .
Dear Mr. Smith,
It is only two or three years since I have used a computer at home , but now I wonder how I can live without it .
I had to buy my dress , it 's accessories and besides clothes and souvenirs !
During the rescue , every second is valuable !
When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor .
More healthcares are needed for elderly people than young adults .
The advertisement said there were discounts available , which were not .
Moreover , what do think about how much pocket money we will spent on this trip .
Moreover , achieving the near impossible to eliminate all the illness such as cancer and diseases is the greatest achievement for human race .
I hope you understand .
COULD YOU PLEASE BE SO KIND AND CHANGE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE WILL HAVE ?
Without the using of the surveillance , the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly , and the loss caused by SARS might be many times more than that in 2003 in Singapore .
Anni Soler
Will you provide me an instructor when I climb and swim ?
Dear Sir Madam ,
Mar<unk> ous thing !
Other diseases such as mental disorders and heart trouble are also top killers , the current medication does have methods to treat the patient , but risks still come along .
Because the land is limited , so the average land for one person is very small already .
And all the evidence has been collected by hidden surveillance when he thought he was expressing his opinion in the safe house !
Such technology would put people into the same circumstances as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second .
I never thought that I would win the competition .
Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable .
It was a summer night and all the citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend .
However , this will raise a privacy protection issue .
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation .
Respect is essential .
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel .
After a certain age , they will have to retire .
This also works and we have also seen the effects .
1 .
To sum up I enjoy wasting money and buying useful things or not .
As what we have mentioned above , as human beings , we should enjoy our privacy as long as we do not cause harm to others .
Yours sincerely ,
As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & bought bread for the evening .
Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family from losing their members , especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to .
According to your brochour , it started to show at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m .
We had fun at 5 o'clock !
Love from ,
People in general are compulsory for shopping in my opinion .
Second , I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening .
Deception ?
In the era of Warring State , warriors lose their arms or legs or even all of them .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I got an appointment with the Dentist .
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
I would like to complain about the show which you presented last Saturday .
Thus , let 's discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer mind of surveillance technology .
We would have to forgo shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of dead people annually .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make better security of people 's lives .
Thank you in advance .
BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I WAS DISAPPOINTED .
In addition to this , I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I had out and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refound of a part of the money I wasted there .
That 's why I could n't have dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
First of all , the only suitable time for me to go is July .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night .
For privacy concern , if the technology can be made to adjust to human beings ' feelings , it will be more welcomed .
It is a country without any freedom or democracy in the novel .
Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks .
But in which way ?
While it is applaudable that people achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posted by the rising life expectancies .
When these scholars are on a field journey , they also have to relate their observation with their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .
I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London a few time ago .
I am writing to express my disappointment about the play <unk> <unk> over the rainbow '' which is performing at Circle Theatre .
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
An example is the Nazis secret police of Hitler used to dispose ( their bodies literally ) and stamps out any of Hilter 's oppositions using fear ( and maybe guns , knives , poison ) .
In other words , I can also receive their reply soon .
I learnt from you letter that I 've won first prize .
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June , so I can only travel in July .
First , I will discuss on the challenge of having an aging population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall .
How are you ?
I have recently bought a new camera .
I have to use a computer every day .
It 's terrible !
It was a surprise to know that I won first prize .
Firstly , knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger .
In addition , an aging population will require more health and treatment because one 's constitution weakens one year .
I 'm Francesco Schein , I 'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show <unk> <unk> Over the Rainbow '' .
I JUST TO PLAY TENNIS THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS .
Concerning the available activities , firstly , I would choose climbing because I have practised it for many years .
It was really wonderful .
Basketball I have been playing in a team , of my town for ten years .
In reality , people are afraid of being tracking everywhere , not because of meaning to crime , but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone 's heart .
More importantly , they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through the Internet , to make more interested people get involved and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful .
This would result in a decrease in the birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail , as normal mail .
My name is Marie Bouchard , I come from Switzerland .
Without a doubt , the rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical industries in finding out ways and medicine to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases .
What do I have to pay by myself ?
And he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house .
It helps me in preparing for my homework .
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family .
However , during my stay at Camp , there are two activities I can choose , one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most. My friend and I used to win the first place in a school-wide match when we were in school .
We will be able to accelerate the process of computer games , for example ,
Cars and trucks diminish the entire time shipment .
More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government .
There are two possibilities .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON .
This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries , and hence affecting the productivity of the world .
The show lasted nine hours , from 10.00-19.00 , the whole day !
She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her .
Of course , yes !
When I get to the camp , I 'd like to swim and climb .
For all these reasons , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
This book helps us to impove our logic , mind , memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes it can help us very very much .
It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity is made in it .
Can you send me the letter back writing what has happened to you recently ?
The tags can be used on those who need to be taken care or the beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerned about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lose her .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the courtines ( opening and closing ) when Nick came to me and asked me to go on stage with him , my heart started beating very hard .
If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want .
So could you give us permission to go ?
For society , there will be a more efficient transportation system .
I WAS REALY SCARE .
The improvement in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works .
At that time I used the computer only to play with its video games .
I hope you understand your faults and I 'm asking you for the money back .
Nowadays , things have changed .
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy .
Only if it be made use in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly , can it bring us the maximized benefit .
I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food you can work part-time , four , three , six hours every day .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage .
Now you 've probably asked yourself what it means , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
You offer a great variety of activities .
I thank you for organizing it , and hope to see more next year .
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ THE STARRING .
We had a quite pleasant time except in the evening .
I have always dreamt about holidays in Camp California .
I hoped that it , just could see 3 people , but it was a mistake ... Pat saw it !
Finally , we worked the hohl night before the concert .
Another thing I want to complain about is that your advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .
According to your advertisement , the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
As world pace becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .
The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if the population ages ; a high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive aging people .
My suggestion for next year 's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer !
That was why she decided to change her behaviour .
Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor .
I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping , I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
In solution , surveillance technology has been used in a much broader area .
Without sending back any images or sound records , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user 's privacy at the best it can .
For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buying clothes , cosmetics , accessories , jewels etc .
The development of technology brings people joy , making things easier and this may be one of the achievements .
I thought that I found a good friend in my life .
Maria was nervous , but for the first time , she could talk to him as she never did before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person of the world , she gave her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back , after all , everything happened because of her .
I 'm writing back to answer the questions that you send me in the past letter , so refering to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during july , because I have to be in August back home , because I need to apply and get everithing sortted out , to go into college next september .
She was given a chance : if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would have started trusting her .
The rising average life expectancy can surely cause some problems .
She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared .
This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .
Two days later in the morning , the policeman came to Peter .
I have never had any experience living in a tent , so I would like to give it a go .
The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear .
Finally I would like to have a refund for my ticket back because it was a horrible evening .
They are imported from other Western Europe countries .
The technology is based on a tip implant or tag .
Somebody could give you not enough change .
Although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies , it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement .
I can send them anytime I like .
I 'm also fond of tennis , I 've just started my lessons and would like to continue practicing during the summer .
I would be grateful if you could .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
However , as the technology develops , it increased people 's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies .
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time making intimate friendship with people around me .
In the future , every child might have a laptop .
However , there are other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .
and of course , I am very happy .
The car and the man were not there anymore .
Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
Nevertheless , humans still need improvement .
I never accused her of lying , and I you ask me why , I really do n't know .

DEAR MS. RYAN ,
Dear Mr. Smith,
Well , it was the beginning of my tragedy .
I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .
For example , thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone 's location .
Take Singapore for example , these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places , from condominiums to housing development board houses , and even from school canteens to toilets !
I felt very angry with Pat and I should n't have told her about my boyfriend .
and how much will I spend there ?
We can find information about the weather , sports on our TV-text .
The show started at 20<unk> 15 instead of 19<unk> 30 , it 's a theatre but not a concert hall ! ! !
However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy .
Dear Clark,
See you soon .
The rest of their life has to be relied on their family and financial support from others .
!
Yours sincerely,
Please answer my letter as soon as possible .
Do you have any idea what the weather is going to be ?
Dear Miss , Ryan .
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off in the beginning of the month .
And nobody told me why !
Population is large while the resources are limited , which will incur many problems such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
How would you feel ?
We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old .
It is unavoidable for some socialists to argue that surveillance technology invade human rights , however , for the sake of whole society , surveillance technology should still be used .
I was wondering .
I am a painter in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes , people , and animals .
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect .
In modern society , public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon .
It was boring for everybody .
The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT .
No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .
The increasing in population of a country makes the government taking more difficulties of registers the members of each individual family and hence other factors existed as an obstacle of country development .
We had many common interests in music , art and books .
Third , to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of authority .
In addition , it is also a challenge for the government , family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial .
This was her fault .
The town became peaceful again .
I hope you keep in great form , like you were the last time I saw you , how is your family , I hope everyone is ok .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
The rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals ' privacy .
They signed my diary and took a photo with me .
From my point of view , the Internet can be used in education , because it gives an opportunity to have distant relations between pupils and teachers .
The fashion of nowaday clothing is just kept on changing .
Yours faithfully,
I would prefer accommodations in log cabins because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
Thirdly , compared to young people , the security of the elderly is more notable .
The worst thing is that I could n't watch my favorite actor .
On medicine , people have done a lot of researches on life science .
Finally , I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California ?
Other than that , safety issues can be extended to personal safety .
I would like to have my money back .
Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in places like airports and checking points .
In fact , there is nothing very important I did , because we are not the right people to do it .
TO SUM UP , I DID NOT SPEND A PERFECT EVENING .
I am very happy to win the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track people no matter through human implants or tags on products .
When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer .
Goods are dead , but humans are alive .
Yours faithfully,
Also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose .
Dear Jane Clark ,
This is the prize .
He complained a lot .
The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters .
They breathe , eat , feel and besides that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .
In such a situation , individuals will lose their basic privacy .
Therefore , for ordinary people , there is no need for them to use this technology .
Do I need any formal ones ?
The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer .
WE SAW THE ACTIVITIES PROGRAM ALREADY AND WE THINK IS EXCITING , ESPECIALLY THE VISIT TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
I was wondering if I needed to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency .
As society develops , people gradually find that population aging brings us many problems .
With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population , increasing amount of nurses and doctors will have to be present .
It would be great if we could choosen swimming and golf .
To make him or her more competitive so that not to be beat by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
The war kills a lot of people , which is not doubtful .
It is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history .
As technology has become more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to various types of technology in their daily lives .
Technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease the illegal actions effectively .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
I wonder if it is all right for that time .
The musical should have begun at 19<unk> 30 , but it started at 20<unk> 15 ; it is inacceptable !
Another success .
Thus , food can play an important role in the population .
Yours sincerely,
For example , the politicians have chosen their careers , they must know that they are going to be involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .
Yours sincerely,
Lots of love,
The world is always fair to us .
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions , make up , hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends .
One day she invited me to her flat .
There is no absolute perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Many pupils in China have been complaining about their phones , because with the phones at hand , their lives are all transparent to their parents .
Even though people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chances to survive and have a longer time to live .
Such incident happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV ( ) on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .
For these older people , the society needs man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .
Secondly , it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents .
I would choose Basketball and Tennis .
I always watch NBA matches on T.V .
In an aged population , low spending affects economic growth .
As with the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Does this sound reasonable to you ?
I hope you 're well and enjoyed with the CD and do n't forget to write back all about your news during my summer holiday job .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about .
Thanks to his habit , he is still alive and all the money was backed to the bank .
I hope that it will be a good holiday for her , her family and friends .
Statistics shows that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
Yours sincerely,
The super markets are also using this technology to tag their product , which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent stealing .
I had to go home without eating dinner , though I was really hungry .
Population aging is a challenge for economic development .
It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown .
Then , the show began 45 minutes later , so we had to wait very long .
There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
I was so annoyed !
Whenever he has secrets , his nose moves quickly .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to give examinations for the First Certificate in English .
Leon Hofmann
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car .
However , it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in the workforce .
It 's seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the lesson of Chemistry in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of instruments and really some very good professors , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory
First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .
I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on it .
Sorry I have n't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job .
And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there ?
Increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply .
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but at the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
Two weeks ago , I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend .
About accommodation , I think tents would be great .
Yours faithfully,
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
Peter and Sue asked Francis some help for their exam 's subjets and Francis , for helping them , was very busy all week .
I hope you are going to take into consideration my terrible situation .
Yours faithfully,
As we have mentioned above , the increase of life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge .
I worked in a team with seven people .
Dear Mr. RR,
I was wondering if there is a coach who could give us a lesson during the Camp .
We revealed our locations , for our friends to catch up with us , however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly .
To conclude , the rising life expectancy must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
We might still favour the old carpet and couch .
The arts students want to learn another foreign language .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends ' home , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behavior .
Finally , the company tracking system has no meaning at all , therefore the tracking system is very terrible measure to control people .
Once it is very severe , the records will be pop out for official use .
With the internet you can do whatever you want without going out home ( shoping , speaking with a friend , working , putting your money aside ... . )
Finally , when the musical show finished , and I had to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .
Yours faithfully,
If that technology is abandoned , it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or steal things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than saving a man 's life .
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government .
Is the camp close to town or city ?
Yours faithfully,
Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .
I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me .
I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings , but on the day I saw it , a different actor played .
For instance , when people get old , they begin to lose their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful .
The second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys .
Longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over .
An even larger share of the old people 's expense lies in health care .
If we want to leave a good world for the next generations , we should behave more respectfully against nature .
My favorite sports courses are swimming and basketball .
Also , the population aging calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology , higher level of civilization of our life .
Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible ?
In case , they have some accidents like heart attacks , the track of them will show there is something wrong .
We live in a very busy world !
The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher .
For example , I was born knowing that the man had stepped on the moon .
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet other personalities .
Moreover , students are allowed to admit free .
First , medical costs will increase greatly .
To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life .
He becomes lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and turn the chances on the TV by pressing a boton .
It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out .
On the other hand , the facilities for access to the mall center is not good .
Thank you for your attention .
According to article Lawful Interception , in US , every telecommunication companies have contract with the FBI , requiring them to keep the phone call record easily and easily search and accessible for the FBI .
I need to dress up neatly in case one day someone checks the CCTV will find a girl in weird clothing .
With a double life time , humans can change to explore the real meaning of life .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
On the other hand , the technology can also be probably used by lawbreader to commit crimes .
Although we are not implanted chips we are exposed to CCTV .
I wanted to sleep and very annoyed .
Finally , I would be grateful to you , if you told me about clothes and money .
That is to say , there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology .
I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies .
Maybe , in a few years later we 'll have a bigger TV , a more suitable radio but , from my point of view , I think these facts will not change the way of our lives .
People may say that surveillance technology will be abused intentionally by authorized people .
Dear Mr. Robertson
It functions to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
Is necesarilly bring to me money there ?
This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread .
I 'm not as good as her , but I 'm going every week once to her training .
Bank robbers said him if Pat told the fact somebody they killed him .
You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order .
Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in a few minutes and as soon as you can regret buying all these clothes , which you do n't really need .
ONE THE ONE HAND , THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES .
If you do it , there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them .
And many people are in a hurry , so do n't wonder if other people have no tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars .
She just thought it would be a secret , she came really embarassed .
Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilization<unk> requires at least three conditions to happen : advanced health care system , reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
and we love each other very much .
If a developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which includes reducing the hazards from the environment .
Can you compare it to me ?
However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home addresses , working addresses to someone who is not authorized to get the information .
However , an aging population is relaxing in a country .
So , I think I 'll do sailing and tennis .
Yu Phu Tung .
This can help regulate people 's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .
Furthermore , some concert halls were definitely too small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .
They are expecting better medication , healthier food , and cleaner environment and so on and so forth .
Thank you very much for your recent letters .
I also chose painting because I have never done it before , but I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a calm activity .
When the holidays begin everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us .
I 'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday .
I wo n't forget him .
For the old people , if they are alone at home , one day , they want to go out for a walk .
It 's very important but sometimes it is a wrong thing because the children can see it too .
First , the actor changed and his performance was very poor and disappointing .
On the other hand , if you ask me I have the chance to choose two activities while I am at the camp .
Still the possible downfall of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly outweigh the benefits , in my opinion .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Although life expectancy may increase significantly , the population overall productivity may not increase as early as possible .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I would also like to specify if the food is included in the prize .
I have known her for five years .
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .
For developing countries , they may encounter more about the shortage of food resources and the problem of how to develop a better medication system to serve the entire nation , and they also face the problem of how to distribute the wealth evenly to benefit the entire population , more over they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation of the population will be able to carry on to raise the whole country .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT .
By law , citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public , whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely .
I use technology every moment but I did not realise .
At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones , which gives the younger generation extra works .
This is more convenient for the authority to take better control of the society down to every individual .
She did n't tell me yet but when I came in class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .
Of course , more money will be spent .
Consequently , the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen .
These days we can use computers , television and some sophisticated equipment .
This form of tracking was also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race .
Our lives are changing .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts .
Dear Kim ,
To the Manager of
Surveillance technology such as RFID can be operated twenty-four hours with the absence of operators to track done every detail about human activities .
Which temperature will be in the summer season in this area ?
However , if they have some special day when like important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which you have never seen before .
Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy life , it sounds perfect , but we must face to the reality -- there is no Utopia .
THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT .
It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock .
The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I am in charge of project which starts in June so I am sure I could n't go later ) .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .
They are filled with people who go buy everything .
My friends lent me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds .
We all prefer the show , free time is not so important for us .
A. Becker
This holiday will help me to think and prepare for it .
I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected .
In conclusion , advanced technology gives people convenience to find their items and their safety .
Since we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality , we are leading a longer life .
There would be many things to say about .
The show will be about all the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
Many violence happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resources .
The show is on Tuesday the 14th between 10.00- 13.00 .
Firstly , the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagine , I was very disappointed .
In conclusion , to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .
Hence , the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly .
In addition , for observation journeys and traveling , we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
Besides that , ageing population has an important and essential thing that we can not buy in cash .
The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me .
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
What do you think about this ?
It is proud to have the aging population which is hard to achieve unless there are advanced medical technology and higher living standards .
Besides , we should not forget the responsibility of our shoulder , the older people .
I would also like to know how much money I can bring .
I wasted too much time waiting .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthier .
By logic it seems perfectly right .
In advance , thank you .
Dear Mr. Smith,
Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
I have got very responsible work I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders .
On the other hand , the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing , whose figure is the lowest record compared to the previous figure .
Nowadays , the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
However , the health level of world population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in number of elders worldwide .
When I work , it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relaxed at work .
I prefer living in a log cabin , because it is more comfortable .
And , I have to return to my university by August .
Dear Madam , Jim,
Therefore , this technology should be used to truck people .
To sum up , with rising life expectancies , there exists both achievement and challenge .
And checking his body condition .
I 'd like to ask some questions which I want to know .
People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but to keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode .
In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like familiar problems or personal problems .
It 's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
London is the place to be when something is happening .
In fact , to do shopping can be some disadvantages for different reasons :
Many industries throw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it before .
Many advantages have been shown in areas like politics .
Over these years , it has helped humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard ; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation .
I 'd better leave now .
However , not many young people are passionate about helping the society or even helping the elderly .
The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history of human civilisation .
At that time , the Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient 's home to look after their actions .
13th June , 2000
If such a thing does happen , then the society would be moving in a dangerous direction without being noticed .
The high accuracy in utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreements among people .
I just received your letter with good news .
I would like to answer .
In addition to this , you started the show 45 minutes late .
Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used for protecting us from criminals , nowadays , it seems to be abused too much .
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer something to someone .
Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is implanted into the body of animals .
Isabel Cruz
For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is general .
If RFID is used on everyone and running for years , the surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city , from town to town , which city is expanding more than people thought , which city is becoming less attractive .
In conclusion , there are challenges as well as achievement in the rising life expectancies which we can not exclude .
Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for making clothes and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday .
We also do not want to see the worse things that parents are dropped by children along the streets and let them die themselves .
Further more , yesterday I 've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view in 2050 year everybody will fly to the space .
HE TOOK ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
Everybody knows everybody .
We found our family there and our lives .
However , video surveillance may be a help to most sectors , it can also be misused by many people .
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you communicate I have won first prize in your competition .
Therefore , the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive .
I am writing this letter to you , because the show <unk> <unk> Over The Rainbow '' which is the London 's newest and best musical show , was not ... for me .
Thank you .
We have no experience but we like to learn this game .
Both the library and the museum apply this technology to avoid some belongings being taken out illegally .
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose. It is also used to track people by doing human implants .
When surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life , some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe .
I think that , having is a dream '' of all of us .
However my family 's members do less communicate with each other than we used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank for organising a school trip to London .
This job was quite hard , but we took enough time to be not exhausted !
I am really happy to receive your congratulations .
Such a situation is a major progress from the ancient times and also a big achievement by all human beings .
Is it possible to get there ?
I want if it is possible a log cabins like accommodation because I have been suffering from my back since my childhood , therefore I need comfortable accommodation .
Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human beings .
So I can recommend you to present this book , because it is very interesting , amusingly dramatic and mystery book .
We do n't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school .
Yours sincerely,
But it was closed .
So more manpower will be employed , which deduces the labour in other areas .
I like shopping at all with my best friend .
Some friends phoned her everyday , except Pat , the only friend Maria really loved , despite that , she was not sad .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
However , although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again , the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacy .
THE REASONS ARE ; DISTANCE , LACK OF CAR , CROWDED STREETS , TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP .
I do not agree with this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
Sincerely yours,
The show started later at 20<unk> 15 which was very different in '19.30 ' as shown .
Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon .
But at home you noticed that there is a tear on sleeve .
And you could n't give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .
As previously mentioned there are benefits to this surveillance and tracking technologies .
Yours faithfully,
Here , red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
The Sports Shop .
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the good programme of our English class in London , especially for a river trip to Greenwich , it will be a great experience for us .
To begin with , you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries .
It is such a challenge that human beings can not avoid and must solve .
Therefore , we need to continue on our efforts as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried .
Healthcare is better than in the past .
For six months I 've worked at a McDonald 's restaurant in Italy and I 've got lots of money .
I think people will wear convenient clothes with simple design in the future .
Therefore , the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
Anyway , it was a great experience in spite of these little problems .
More importantly , Singapore wants to be a knowledge based country , more highly educated people are required .
To conclude , I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable .
As the population aging is growing , as people getting old , they need to be cared for by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young .
Yours faithfully,
Of course in the beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at you 'll also earn some money .
Hence people died of various diseases .
In other words , it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population .
The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Dear Sir-madam
I can tell you I am only free in July .
I like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere when I live in .
If we can not choose the proper way to use it , we can taste the bad consequences of it .
It is very dangerous for society , because people do not know who are tracking them , it must bring citizens carpidation .
With the accomodation , I would prefer tents becase it is more according to a camp .
How could you arrange a job like that ?
Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .
With your best wishes , your
For example , making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided , which is also a effective way to protect human rights .
Carrying big speakers place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughter .
Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money .
According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies .
Yours faithfully,
During the show I was expected to meet Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor and Tina Truelove .
And for the second question .
What about accommodation , I prefer tents to log cabins .
Now , technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace .
Basically my work was carrying the instruments , the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage , which is not an easy work because , as you can imagine , it 's not exactly light stuff .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won first prize .
IN THE FUTURE , PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW .
If I had known all of them , I would have changed my plan and could have a better time .
One family at least should take care of four older people .
Therefore , people are generally less stressed in working .
just imagine , it was moby , so I went to say hello to him , and he told me would you give me a hand with my decks , so I went , and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row , oh my god Kim that the best thing that ever happened to me , well Kim I hope to receive a letter from you soon. Thank you .
Every coin has two sides .
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give my money back because on the advertisement there was some things that we had n't in the theatre .
After this , it can automatically get the identification and tracking .
Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actor on stage .
It all comes from my parents .
Please let us know , as soon as you make your decision .
It was so exciting !
When the elders live longer , the family size actually increases rather than decreases .
Everyone gathered in the disco at 21.00 .
Some people may claim that it is good for security as when every one is under tracking , those poteintial criminals also are .
It is a progress of human beings that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies , but it also has a potential crisis for either nation or human beings .
In that sense , without a proper way to track human beings , it is way too difficult to save those innocent lives .
Dear Lucas !
I see a very different home for us in the future .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted from around the world .
I hope you will understand me !
I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier .
It is thus a big challenge to the country as there is no one boosting their economy .
First of all I want to congratulate your cousin with my fifteenth birthday and with all the best .
I am really looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July , because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month .
For the colours , I think the metalic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster then in the past , when everything was sent by a common mail , and it took weeks till it got the right place .
Vasiliy .
Do I have to bring any special clothes ?
In the long history of evolution , we are always struggling to live against staving and illness .
Yours faithfully,
Are there any activities which are not included ?
Statistics can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures , what kind of infrastructure and what other development should be made .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam
After the concer finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the success included my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
Oh , for last I just would like to ask you how many clothes and money I have to bring with me .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I am only able to travel in July .
It was so exciting .
This is particularly seen in many parts of the world .
In order to bring more benefit and ensure people 's safety , surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in the UPs and DHL , these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods .
Unfortunately , it is quite expensive , <unk> 32 .
With the help of RFID , if there is an urgent that people crying for help , they would be saved .
In my opinion it would be nice if you could create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments .
We all know that there is an application on the iphone called where is my iphone .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
How can you earn money in your spare time ?
Anyway , now I have to stop to finish my homework .
With the information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save energy and resources of the company .
It will also induce many problems .

Would not it be similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , I knew that he 's a very talkative person , but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main director of that birthday party for tenes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely,
It can probably be divided into several types .
It is difficult to keep the economy functioning well .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Although in many respects , this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some areas it is so controversial .
I am not telling about some kind of achivements in those discipines but It is my big pasion
Because life and health are most significant , people have their own reasons to hope living longer .
However I ca n't agree with opinion that , Shopping is not always enjoyable '' I think that everybody likes to buy but not everybody likes to see pleasure in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
This is an age which most people are retired and has no sources of income .
" The Big Brother is watching you " ( Orwell , < 1984 > ) , the fictional world described in George Orwell 's novel now turns out to be true .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisment about fashion and leisure shows in London .
To sum up , all you make in small cuantities is good and funny , but do n't encrease them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day .
In conclusion , I have to declare that my myself and my fellow students will be available to help this short video by all means .
I think you should check the information before printing it !
Dear Sir Madam ,
How much money should I take with me ?
I have n't written you for ages .
After that I turned on the car light in order to tell the passing cars .
I think it 's a part of our lives .
ON THE OTHER HAND , THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE WHO WOULD WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE .
I 've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax myself and to leave the city , which is very extressing .
We really like London , the people , the night-life but this evening was really awful .
It is to prevent them from sending them to old folk houses and do not visit them at all .
However , in some opinions , these auto-tracking services break the rule of privacy .
Also , in August I will be studying a summer English course .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
True enough , their population is aging but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming .
As the rise of life expectancy can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development , it can be seen as a achievement of human being .
Policeman can just go to a certain place and chase the criminal .
Children can be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
Therefore , the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs .
More elderly people are a burden to the society as more funds are required by the governments to support their standard of living .
Moreover , some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that aim for the examination .
The great idea of making it <unk> <unk> international '' was unfortunately not brought to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be <unk> <unk> from around the world '' ) were from only six countries .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
Our life is not only exposed to big brother .
I was enthusiastic about receiving your letter .
I think a good way to get money is to work in a fast-food .
Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were going and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to go by bicycle .
Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature , it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics .
So,
Thank you very much for your letter .
The libraries also use this technology to identify the membership of the people entering , which ensures the security and the member itself will also conserve their information made in this library .
Yours sincerely,
All the passengers and pilots died .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it .
The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
They always find a problem .
From another perspective , there are more and more elder people but less younger ones , the increase in population age has weakened the labor force and so on .
It may cost a higher social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds in the government yearly budget .
Yeah ! ! !
12 Barcicka Str .
There are Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead .
However , we can take the essence and reject its dross .
how much money and by cash or by traveling cards ?
With the installing of the surveillances for every corner of Singapore , people 's lives have a safe security , and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments .
In conclusion , we could see that on order to solve the challenges such as the amount of illness that could be growing over the year , the damage to our living environment and stress that are always building in the city life .
Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .
Since we do not to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee , enormous time has been saved for everybody .
Such a nightmare owes to abuse of Surveillance technology .
I was very disappointed after this show .
Apart from this , I have n't spent my free time in technology .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Moreover , the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing .
With a more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment , population aging always comes first .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon .
With proper use of surveillance technology , surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police , and also benefit all the society .
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's , and the Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie '' .
One day she realized that I was always outside of circle .
More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
On Friday evening and on weekdays , each supermarket is crowded .
Okay , I hope to hear from you soon .
A possible benefit is better statistical analysis , which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies .
Basketball will help children to build team characters and leadership .
All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like , the time of tracking and who can view your location .
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I disliked very much the impuntuality , but that was not all .
Pressure can really cause sickness just like a virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease .
Surveillance technologies should also not be used to protect people 's liberty and freedom of opinion .
Thank you for everything !
Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner .
This important information may be needed to save the person life where their medical history was all recorded in the chip .
He wanted everything that his eyes saw .
Ongelina
Using the equipment and area what we have to organise some activities .
It was a sign in front of the restaurant <unk> <unk> sorry we closed because of the special reasons '' and I was wondering what was the reason for that .
Additionally , you could n't believe , but the vocalist said <unk> <unk> All the chairs you are sitting down were set from him , '' pointing at me ! !
We are all looking forward to your answer .
If we are talking about accomodation then accomodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I would like to ask about clothes .
We can not give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and be reborn .
The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life , and then the surveillance is no more needed .
They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
She was so touched that we started to cry .
As this information is been well maintained by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form .
Bianca Botticelli
Besides that , many animals which just be released from the protection of humans for a long time are implanted the RFID as well to track their new life to ensure whether they could survive in the wild life .
Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .
Privacy must be respected , and power over the other should be controlled .
During scientific exploration , especially the geographical ones , the tracking is very important .
Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues .
Dear Mrs. ,
Yours sincerely,
In my opinion , shopping sometimes is really boring , especially when you buy at the supermarkets almost all the time the same things like cleaning products and the ingredients for every day food .
Even if the safety is the most important thing to consider in a normal life , many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing potential dangers .
Before robots can fully replace labor , the decreasing of generating power indicates less creativity and less goods available for us to use .
Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement .
Therefore , surveillance technology makes our society more ordered .
Thank you for your letter .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show .
After all , it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows , especially the developed countries with a very small population .
How are you ?
However , when we look at the brighter side of the reality , the rise in life expectancy proves great improvements in various realms and solved many problems we had in the past , there is hope that the aging population may transform into helpful force to a country in the future with the help of better technology and medication .
My exams will finish at the end of June .
There were n't any discount available as you 'd assured in the add .
I 'm not really sure of what kind of clothes to take , could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable ?
I am writing to you about the show .
Despite this , I 'm convinced that all this progress caused some damage in the community , not only physically .
The next breakthrough is probably around the corner in the near future .
That was a rare case since Singapore is actually an absolutely safe country .
She could n't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with .
I must insist that you will refund the cost of the show .
It really disappointed me .
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .
Yours sincerely,
I am writing to complain about a musical show on 10 of June , and I was very disappinted .
As we can use the resources with maximum efficiency , we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society .
Since we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Secondly , for the older people , more facilities and services for them should be provided .
It records the history of which nobody can deny .
Yours sincerely,
Dear Man,
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE WONNER OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH .
The sales assistants in the stores are n't so nice and helpful .
With this advantage , it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes .
I am glad I had taken part in a few competitions , and I was so proud of our basketball team .
I swim really well and I am a professional basketball player .
The rising life expectancy is like a two side sword to the modern world .
I did not have a good time for all of these reasons and I would like you to give my money back .
I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .
More than that , when I bought the ticket I did n't get any discounts .
If you want to help , here is a list of what you can do . ''
When I find a new message , I 'm very happy .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
Therefore , population aging should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
All students are very pleased and we are looking forward to going to London .
However , the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly , and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned .
My Mum was at home and I told her all the story .
Dear Mr. Smith,
It is a coinsidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
No matter which reason stated above exactly dominant to the rising of life expectancies it is one of the evidence of the achievement of human nation .
People must make sure that the government is not abusing its power in ways , including tracking people .
Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometimes telephone .
This will save the customers time and also improve the profit of the market .
Some have been widely accepted by the public but some are not .
Furthur more , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
The land space will be limited when more hospice is to take care of the elderly people .
Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is increasing longevity and declining fertility .
Thank you very much for the prize .
Therefore , we must encounter challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation .
Dear Kim ,
I went to the theatre at 7 o'clock but , with my surprise , the show started at 20<unk> 15 and so I could n't remain here until the end because I left London , with my group before the end of the show .
Dear Mr. RR,
At that time , even if there is no surveillance above people 's heads , there are surveillances in everyone 's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide .
An individual is an unit of society , every good individual thus is a precious contribution to society and nation 's growth .
I have to go .
Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .
We do not want to be sued infringing other 's privacy , therefore , before implanting any RFID , we should ask for other 's consent .
After I told her I felt my feelings had been released and I was happy .
The technology is always improving and it never stops , and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well .
Also , not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down , but also jailbreakers .
In addition , people who research biodiversity will also need to be tracked .
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING , WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY IN CLOTHES .
I felt unhappy sometimes .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
The worse thing is that one may not even be aware of that he or she is being tracked .
The problems that you have here are the weather .
Disabled people walks with artificial legs , a man can get pregnant , even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery .
As I did n't have a <unk> <unk> perfect evening out '' , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .
Another thing was that there was no discounts available , and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
I started early in the morning to help carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played , I help with the music stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound , etc .
In China , things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough .
With good communication and interaction , an elderly can guide the young with valuable lessons in life .
Would you tell me how much money you would give it to me and how the weather is like in the U.S.A ?
But , it was not available .
For the fashion of the future , I think it depends on the people 's own personalities and develop their own styles which suits them the most .
I would be grateful if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 , not on 19.30 .
However , the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to human society .
It can provide an objective view of what happened .
During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit restaurant , it 's a pity , but the restaurant was closed because it was too late .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people .
Back to the ancient days , when human beings first appeared on Earth , the average life expectancy is only less than 20 .
But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?
I have to say that the evening was terrible .
Yours sincerely,
IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT .
Pat could n't stand the pressure of the <unk> <unk> crime '' so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .
First of all , there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement .
I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop .
And the other they choose sometimes just for the label .
I counted on my experience .
Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of the progress of modern medical technology .
I think I will enjoy myself in a tent .
I am writing to complain about your product .
There are two points supporting this argument .
Diana Delgado
If you need money and you need time for yourself to try a job like that .
Thank you .
When the authority treats liberty as a crime , the society becomes terrible .
I strongly suggest you should give us the right information .
Particularly I am pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world .
Some days ago , when school was ending , Pat and her friends decided to make a party for their friend , Frances , because the end of the school and the Francis 's birthday were the same day .
At the beginning I would like to answer questions you asked me in your letter .
An improvement in engineering and medical science has been valued since humanism arises .
I am writing to you about my experience at a pop concert .
Yours sincerely,
Besides , as the development of the technology , medical therapy also has tremendous progress .
The speed of spreading was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
I felt how lucky I was .
It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition , the people will have a good skin complexion .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there are many problems if it prevails .
It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death , thus living longer .
But at the brakes and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engieners , and I learned something about setting up the equitment .
My boy friend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the times came .
Times change , people change .
The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility .
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information from me that you need to make me have a good time at Camp California .
I have recently been in London for a week 's holiday .
For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .
We do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal .
What do students do now ?
Moreover , in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case .
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend .
It was a very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
Dear Kim ,
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
I 'm writing you in response to your letter , I was delighted to know that I won the first price .
Thank you and greetings .
I 'm an Italian student who has come to the last International Arts Festival .
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them .
For example , without surveillance technology , the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position .
Compared to the human implant , tags on the products are better and more suitable .
It is clear that problems that may face for developed and developing countries are different .
Hello Kim,
How is the weather in California ?
Dear Mr. Smith,
I think technology has changed my life and the way of living almost all people around the world .
But his nose moved quickly when police showed a picture of a bank robbers .
Does it affect the normal functionality of the other organs ?
Yours sincerely,
<unk> o-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with radio-frequency electromagnetic field .
Yours faithfully,
I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid contacting them .
Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their life has been far easier than before .
The rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of the rising quality of life ; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
Actually it spoiled our time .
With the development of the science and technology , people nowadays are living under various surveillances , for example , CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in the public area .
Dear Sir Madam ,
Marcella , Scalia C .
13 July 2000
We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
And my last question : how many people are going to stay in each tent .
We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
This seems to be a gratifying progress at first sight .
So , I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back .
I will never forget that summer day .
Looking forward to hearing from you
After going through WW1 and WW2 , the population on earth got much fewer .
Especially to the science museum because we all are doing science in school .
It was not good for me , because I had only one week holiday in London .
Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected .
I made a beautiful invite cards for every Agatha friend with a sign <unk> <unk> Do not tell Agatha about that , this is a suprise party for her , please keep the secret ! ''
The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious .
Then the police realized who were bank robbers and arrested them .
Moreover , as we use up more and more resources , what we have left may not be enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resources to do research of developing new technology .
We started our journey and we arrived at our purpose place at 6 o'clock in the evening .
To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes should be built , which adds on to the expense of society .
We were mainly on work for all the lights at this great concert .
I am writing with regard to your advertisement .
A major source of the hazards is pollution .
Although the current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower , manpower is required to operate these machines so that they can better functioned .
Dear Kim ,
These fields are special because of the job category , and the need to be open to the public , so the disadvantages will not be shown .
SO , I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER .
Then , if a business man wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which has gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation .
This creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .
It shows that significant cases of the important of experience .
Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert .
Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present .
It happened in last summer we planned to go on holiday in Southen part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
It was very interesting .
Dear Sir Madam ,
Lausanne , the 20th of May 2000
I 'm waiting for you to hear from you soon .
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show <unk> <unk> Over the Rainbow '' .
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
In the first place , every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being close watched every second .
On one side , we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes .
The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?
But I think that there are limits .
I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible .
I would also like to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip .
The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promise written in the advertisement .
I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing .
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show , that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed .
Today , the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go .
Love , and
The government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of military and national defense sectors .
In addition , it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed .
It 's funny .
Another human identification is Implanting RFID chips into human body .
However , I think such powerful device shall not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned ' individuals .
The first day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
and how much money do we need to take ?
I do not like crowded places .
However , as the energy and resources use up , more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem , so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge .
In addition , if surveillance technology is even better developed , it can be used to detect the problem before the real accident has happened .
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever experienced .
Fewer young people and more elder people are existing globally .
I hope we can catch up with each other 's news .
These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great numbers .
Juliana Piotrowska
Yours faithfully,
The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge .
Personally , I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their lives ; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses die ; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
Their safety may face huge challenges .
Therefore , surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life .
I came into their room and gave hot Cheeseburgers , Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter .
The headmaster did not know how the teacher really was and she did not fire her even when some children were afraid of entering the teacher 's class .
It is called , ,The London Fashion and Leisure Show . ''
Yours faithfully,
In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service .
I 'd appreciate it a lot .
First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A in July because of my university .
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM , WE SUGGEST ON TUSDAY GO TO THE SHOW AND ON WENSDAY INSTED FREE Time , VISIT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , population aging is becoming a problem especially in developed countries .
In my case I dislike computers .
At the beginning I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me a lot .
Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children .
The second day objective was to install the scene .
It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , so it is still my dream because of your show .
And that is always what we want .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accidents , diseases or suicides .
It will be great for me to train basketball in the USA .
Finally , the date of the concer came .
I hope everything around you is alright .
The reason is that we have long holidays at school this time .
With modern machines and growing methods , humans do n't need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets , they are a list of pop bands and groups which will appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
We might even be able to open the door without getting out of the living room .
It would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
The aging population is a consequence of increasing health level of population .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Taken together , we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided .
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available .
I 'm writing to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I went to your theater to see the play called <unk> <unk> OVER THE RAINBOW '' .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rules and cycle , which is a big challenge faced by human beings .
My conclusion on these points is not so bad .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field , continues to get developed and updated , people do n't risk their lives anymore .
Although in those days the only way of learning was reading .
First of all , we were happy to win the first prize in your competition .
It was such a disappointing evening out with my friend during our week 's holiday in London .
In the past , people only can find each other and communicate face to face .
Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
First , if the older people increase , there will be fewer workforces that can support society .
I look forward to hearing from you .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of the logistical hassle .
The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people .
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for human beings .
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs .
Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people .
I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can study the reaction before , during and after shopping .
The bad mood can not give them a longer life .
But I was really disappointed .
But , well , unhappiness started with Pat and my reveilled secrets .
Finally , we like to know , when you send us the airline-tickets and the tripbrochure .
Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as a complete medication system .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , and reliable environment for human beings .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
We waited for ages because we had not been informed .
I was very upset because the show had many problems .
If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
People were claiming to have lost their privacy .
After that , I would like to say thanks , I never have won any price at all .
And according to the question of which type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that the tent is more messy , so I would appreciate if you give me the cabin .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class .
He stayed looking at me and laughing .
It 's really useful when I need a quick reply .
Where every home houses an elderly , the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values .
In any period of time , as long as we do not offense others , we should enjoy the right of privacy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consumes a large amount of energy .
For example , one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city .
Thank you very much for everything .
Surveillance technology should be used to truck people .
I am therefore writing to give you further information .
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complain .
Now population aging is a trend .
I would really appreciate it if you could answer me these questions and say it again .
No matter where people go , taking buses or MRT , people are under the CCTVs , it is very important and useful to track and find people .
I have asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable .
But when I was fifteen my favourite book , " The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie " .
Yours faithfully,
The rising life expectancies may be due to several different reasons , for example , it may be because of the improvement of the living condition , or because of the improvement of the living environment , or because of the development of the medication system in the country .
In summary , surveillance technology shall not be used to track people in order to keep society comfortable and safe to live in .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be expositions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to make up .
Let foreign students do more exercises about English to help them pass the exam .
However , he was not on stage that day .
DEAR SIR ,
Pat 's story
Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it .
The readers are just smiling when they flip the page because it never comes to their mind that one day it might come true .
It made me sad .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favorite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even if I cancel my appointment on that day at 18<unk> 30 and aslo notice of price discount impressed me .
I received your letter two days ago and I 'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E .
Yours sincerely,
I think it 'll also be very different from now on .
People are getting more and more lonely .
In addition , elderly people are using same or even more social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
But tracking people is a very terrible choice , it sounds like people invented a 'prison ' to jail themselves , people need homage and freedom .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , I would be grateful if you could arrange for me accommodation in log cabins as I am not used to living in the countryside and especially in tents .
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage .
I can come to USA on July because in August I will be working with my father .
I had to wait in overcrowded hall .
Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which results in a low life expectancy .
Thank you very much for your last lovely letter .
Next minute , I may have tea with my manager .
Besides , tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
Vasiliy Alekseyev .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people , it is my opinion , that , such technology should rethink its way of existence .
So , when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system , they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards .
Rising life expectancies is also an achievement to governments .
I could n't have all the things I expected .
I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
My work consisted of checking the tickets , the number on them and taking the people to their seats .
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming the first prize that I won in your competition .
Sir manager ,
We should imagine that when life expectancies are raised up ; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising .
However , among the under-developed countries , developing countries and developed countries , we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries followed by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries .
On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancies will cause a larger population .
In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if being used appropriately .
The other activity I would like to take is tennis , I 'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years .
There is no doubt , the tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available .
In order to cope with the aging population that pulls down or hinders economic development , more physically capable and young workforces are required in society .
We had a fantastic time together for three months .
So according to humanism , people should make contribution to raising the human life , because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older , respecting life should be considered carefully .
But , if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same hour as shopping , I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do !
For men , sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat .
There are a series of problems that hinders longevity such as current medication .
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said .
Yours faithfully .
What can I say about television ?
He told me about a concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign .
This is because of two reasons , one is the strict law in Singapore , and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere .
BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
You were disappointed .
This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain to you how .

Hackers become increasingly vicious , invading into our computer system , now with a radio-frequency tracking device , this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons .
BUT SOME PEOPLE DO N'T LIKE DO SHOPPING AT ALL .
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong , if people still increase the humans ' lives , but for these small developed regions , the resources are very limited especially land .
We benefit from Surveillance technology for many years and in many ways .
Dear Mr. RR,
They feel stressful under the control of government and it may lead to the ways that we do not desire and imagine .
Best wishes
Faithfully Yours
Misha ( 2008 ) explains in his book 'McMafia ' that the shadow market accounts for 20 % of the global economy .
Sometimes , older people need more power and resources than normal young people .
I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Therefore , surveillance technology provides convenience to society but makes more inconvenience to individuals .
This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages .
I AM WRITING IN REPRECENTATION OF MY GROUP , AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKE US ABROAD .
It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keeping the life span to grow as people do sick every moment .
Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies ?
How has modern technology changed my daily life .
I have to take care of them during a break , served a drink , clothes , even brought them some cigaratte and anything they wanted .
About accommodation , I would prefer log cabins , because I have a problem with my back .
Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
I am writing to complain about the musical show <unk> <unk> Over the Rainbow '' , that I went to see on the 16th of June .
However , in your letter it is written some activities .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an aggressive employee refused to answer me .
That is why population aging can be seen as an achievement .
The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too .
If everyone is being watched unknowingly , it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded .
In the first place , it must have grasped advanced health care system .
First of all , dishwashers are very efficient for me because I work full time and look after my children .
17 June 2000
I am good at playing tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be useful training for me .
We used to tell each other everything .
When I was a child I had different entertainments that actually children had n't .
Illustration that is both hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies , such as the Bourne identity .
There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend .
All these technology advancement also helps to improve the lives of human race in terms of improving the lifestyle , environment and medical ability .
Basically , I do n't like staying in a small tent .
In addition , although you advertised the discounts tickets available , they do not sell them any more according to your staff .
So , I started to speak English with him .
However , these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for society .
But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsie .
First of all , I am available to travel in July from the 1st to the 20th because my university will be closed during this month .
Example of this technology is RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people .
I believe that if somebody wants fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results .
Because , I am a student and in June , I will still have school .
Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years , in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps humans to live longer and enjoy the world even more .
In this fast moving society , technology is always improving to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army usage to track people down .
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen .
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for students like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show had to start at 19.30 but on that day it was delayed for about 45 minutes .
Now all the Pat 's friends do n't tell her about their secrets because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more comfortable than in a tent .
Nothing was serious .
On the other hand , I will also discuss the RFID shall be utilized for good purposes .
This shows the rising of life expectancies , it is an achievement and it is also a challenge .
XXXX
With reference to the date , I can only go on July , as I 'm going off on holiday in August , and I start university in September .
From my point of view , the real question is : Who said that is enjoyable ?
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals ; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time .
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy .
I spent two days there , and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been to .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designers brands , which are made of special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
He always tried to say nothing and did .
Last month I enjoyed helping at the concert of <unk> <unk> Modern Talking '' and now I want to share with you about my experience .
THEY CAN SAY , SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE 'BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD IN CATALOGUES IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER .
People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies .
I must wash the dishes from time to time ( I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty ) and clean our house .
It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in .
But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it !
I have chosen these activities because actually I am playing with university team , and photography is my favorite hobby .
Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage during the play .
I look forward to hearing from you
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to society .
In this case we are going to focus on me .
In addition , it can also prevent theft .
'As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions .
There is no denying that every coin has two sides .
It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the living of old people .
I THOUGHT IT WILL BE AT 19 , and I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES ! !
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps .
For example , we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone .
However , besides tracking goods for people , people begin to use this technology to track people .
In economics , we can use GDP to explain the challenge , if GDP is low , it shows that most of people are living in a hard life , life quality is bad , then it will cause the terrible society problem , at last , it will happen the society disturbance .
He was really bad .
Dear Sir ,
However , based on the humanism , humans are different from the animals , people should respect every life .
Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs of some of which I put in the envelope .
I understood you want to know when I am available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
There is always a way out where the achievements were done by humans who used their time to help most people improve our basic needs and life for the living and extension of our life expectancy .
Power is concentrated on a few people .
Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from sun-burn , and it 's the most trendy fashion of the year !
A balanced phenomenon should be seen in one nation .
I 'm writing to complain about the service you 'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre .
Manela B .
You should back my money immedeastry because that night was far from perfect .
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , a his friend , asked him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .
However , this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device .
With the moral of filial , most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life .
With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays , human lived longer and hence , a great increasing in population .
I want to thank you for taking me into consideration in your competition .
We do not consider our offspring much .
Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to go shopping in the afternoon .
Please let me know if you agree with us !
AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING .
In this , I mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species , for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime .
Competition Organiser
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied with your information and I ask some money back .
The most controversial part may be human identification .
I would be also grateful if you could send me information about the average living cost at California as I have to arrange the amount of money that I am going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILIES ( IT 'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM , TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER , LUNCH OR BREAKFAST ) .
So I was really surprised .
In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say , that I am quite good in climbing .
Soon after coming into an industrial age , human released the weapon and brings up a new technologic era .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing above all on Saturdays when you have finished a work week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
As the standard of living increases , the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies , which have advanced over the decades , among the general public has become increasingly available .
( CNN , 2011 ) However , only one year has passed , most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory .
And also the over crowded modern cities also raise problems of public transportation , unevenly distributed wealth and education resources shortage also are the problems that some countries that may face to .
Mr John Smythe ,
However , the need for food is also increasing , so that the competition might become even more frightening .
And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives .
Basketball because I am very good at it , swimming because I like to swim very much but I 'm not a very good swimmer .
In addition , different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner about the musical because the restaurant had been closed .
The aging population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to have a healthy lifestyle by the people .
These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them .
Shopping is boring if you go with people too fussy .
For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers , this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online .
Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose , it is still not appropriate .
It can benefit our mankind if we are appropriately used .
Secondly , in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount .
Dear Kim :
Xavier Fournier
It is stupid , they do not have any goals .
Human rights were raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also living with them .
I am very surprised to have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won a prize in your competition .
Indeed , thanks to improving living standard and medical care , countless people 's lives are extended .
In modern society , privacy is a hot topic in peoples ' minds .
Anyway I 'm not very good at surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can make it .
With more advanced technology in the medicine area , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of others will be familiar to us .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In the afternoon she had phoned at a Francis 's mother and she explained her the secret , then she phoned at her best friend and she spoke about that too ; she phoned at many people all the day .
People of the nations are likely to be well-taken care of , partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective government .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way , however , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .
How to explain this problem , it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking systems .
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised .
I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition .
We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed .
YOURS FAITHFULLY
I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations .
Organize better your shows and do not exaggerate with publicity !
By using this card , our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept .
In general , elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults .
This will help the country to move forward rapidly .
Nowadays , technology is more advanced than the past .
For instance , it is funny to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a t-shirt , although you do not buy anything .
With the help of Internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world , it gives me a chance to improve my English .
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PLAY IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY .
Without give really importance to the calidad , because people in general they do n't spend the time preparing food and when they go shopping they choose pre-prepared food .
Firstly , we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show .
Many of this surveillance are being implemented in the government sectors , military areas to enhance their security .
Our suggestion is to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
The modification was so obvious that people can easily recognize .
Rising life expectancies result in fewer workforces available .
Firstly , although the treatment is reliable , people still need to have the awareness of their own health condition .
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request .
With the popularization of surveillance technology , a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed .
In addition , the tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way .
But , as the days went by , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used to not telling her secrets any more .
Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankrupt , and thus people 's lives will definitely get worse .
This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies .
You might understand how excited I was .
Not only has the family member of the old people , but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situations .
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time .
On the other hand , I 'm keen on painting , however , I have never painted in my life , so I would like to try it .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful .
I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .
Pat was worried , she did n't know what to do .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
I hope that the next time you will come with me !
I could n't believe it when he said : <unk> <unk> <unk> K .
However , to a certain extent , I agree to implant RFID tags on products to protect the safety of children .
I was really disappointed at that time .
Because my course wo n't finish until the end of June , and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term .
However , RFID will violate our right of privacy during our shopping activities .
Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever get !
I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
Hehecan just press the button or send an e-mail to operate what heheheneeds , even though the owner is far from the house .
However , there are both sides of the story .
It was already closed when the show finished .
It was such boaring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
It was a big one that I never thought and I could n't imagine how amazing it was .
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures .
Then there comes a problem .
Famous People of the Media
It would be great if life expectancies keep rising day by day , but in reality , it does not seem to be so easy .
Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .
Prisoners ' privacy is endangered due to the RFID .
The aging population is often viewed negatively by the developed countries where they are economic driven .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a <unk> <unk> family '' .
Then I had a chance to speak with them .
Dear Tom .
I like to do some activities in the water and my favourite activity is swimming .
The more exercise or any other forms of work can prolong the lifespan of people .
About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp I would prefer log cabins ; because maybe it is more interesting to share with other people .
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years .
I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students !
Yours sincerely,
Moreover there was no discount ticket .
Without an advanced health care system , aged people have higher rate of death .
As I am very interested in photography and swimming , I am hoping to take part in them .
But I will not tell you more .
I enclose my phone number and address .
In my opinion , modern technologies play an important role in people 's lives .
To conclude , the population aging phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy , medical skills and living standard .
Moreover , the money spend on telephone call records is $ 1.8 million per year .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUN BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY I SHOULD TAKE .
" The weak is meat and the strong eat it " does not apply nowadays .
Well , you can look at your house ... Nowadays , we have all kinds of instruments to wash up the dishes , to cook to be more comfortable , for example the TV , the video recorder , etc .
An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully,
I would like to travel to California in July .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about what the advantages it has made available for human beings .
The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off .
Even pets are granted with freedom , people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential .
Are you afraid ?
I think they are so hospitable and warm with people around them .
Yours faithfully,
See you later .
That is the natural law which nobody can violate .
The woman who sold a ticket was very roud with me , actually she started swearing at me .
I did n't know what my responsibility was until they called me to be trained .
The technology also applies .
As a result , people have more time to enjoy the advantage of modern life .
The most important part is health care and old-age pensions .
It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th of March .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
All of these problems are waiting to be resolved .
Now in Singapore , we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on weekends usally .
I do n't think there is anything I 'd like to change .
AT LEAST I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID <unk> <unk> I 'LL TELL YOU WHERE IS THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR , JUST FOLLOW ME '' .
Oh , sorry they were not in this road , they were on the next road .
there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .
At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh .
Contrarily , it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security .
Everybody knows that , present presents a problem '' You know your own task but what is the task of the other person ?
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time .
So , I do n't think there is anything I 'd like to change .
They waste their time .
That 's a man 's intention .
We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement .
Last year I took part in photograher 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the cathegory of beautiful scenery '' .
In addition , I would like to inform you that I prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I will be at the Camp , as I am an active member of Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon .
People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally .
In the advertisement , you mentioned actors , time , price discount and equipment .
So , I hope I will get my money back , it was very disappointing evening out in my life !
So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me .
I will write to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the travel that I have won in your competition .
In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the , we can go to the show .
And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ?
I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake .
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I came to your theatre .
Nowadays students have much more facilitis in education than before .
Surveillance technology such as <unk> o-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population is potentially is dangerous weapon by the governments against its own people .
It contains a wide range of activities for example , sightseeing , river trip , visiting science museum and gallery , shopping .
Furthermore , such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person .
Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time .
Although that method may invade certain people 's rights and privacy , in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society .
I sent you a copy of our tickets .
Patients in many developing and less developed countries , especially African countries , are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their lives , albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ALWAYS WORRIED .
However , the aging population will also increase many kinds of other expenditures .
I have found it very expensive to buy them but there are number of advantages .
Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case .
DEAR MR ROBERTSON
With the power of internet , there is nothing impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea .
From one perspective , medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases .
I was having some family problems , so my marks were getting down and down .
It may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people commit crime .
The London fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
Would you like living in a modern way ?
The secret was about a surprise party for her best friend 's birthday .
The nightmare started this time .
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had , I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there , but when you said that show was the best I decided to go .
By RFID , the customer who is potential to buy a very expensive luxury will be less reluctant to consider what if it lost , because the RFID can help them get it back .
It was written that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
The people can get there as soon as possible to save them .
This clearly illustrates how a corrupted government may breach its civilians ' privacy .
Can you tell me if it is necessary to bring special clothes , I refer for instance if I practice surfing I need a water suit .
Thanks for your attention and we 're waiting for your answer .
Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
Some good examples such as the Internet , computers and satellites are now quite common for humans ' normal life ; however , some problems also emerge , with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians .
People with rising life expectancies can ensure a large population and large species of human beings .
My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .
More variation of medical needs was required to help increase the life expectancy of any human .
Choosing gave me such big pleasure because I never have to worry from vere do I take money for my wishes .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using .
We put off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard <unk> <unk> What the hell is going on ? ! ! ''
One of the activities I would prefer to do is climbing. I have n't done a lot of it but I 've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better in it .
Dear Kim
I would stand against the idea of tracking individuals given its vulnerability of technology at present .
For example , this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .
The following are the more specific explanations .
There is one question I would like to ask you about the camp .
The population aging is now a heated expression in individuals ' lives .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupt because of illness .
I think that one reasonable priced weekend for all events is excellent idea because it is n't so expensive as buying a ticket to each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
I felt absolutely disappointed .
Now many people know the secret but Pat said everyone : <unk> <unk> I tell you a small secret , but you do n't speak , please ! ''
Although all that may change our houses may be still the same .
Imagine there are no CCTV in public .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre to entertain myself but I wish I 'd not go there because everything went wrong .
It began when our common friends Martha , often me to be an organization member at the concert , obviously I accepted .
it will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show .
This may lead to the younger 's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost .
Dear Mr. Clark ,
We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course !
Dear Sir Madam ,
How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused ?
I do n't know if technology has totally changed my life , because I was born with it and I have learned it since I was a little boy .
Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad .
This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Personally , I think surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people , for the benefit it brings to me can not match the concerns it causes .
Every coin has its two sides .
I especially liked that time .
Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .
It is highly plausible that the results for increasing are the same as those developed countries .
Working with this band was an experience I will never forget .
I am a foreign student who is on holiday here .
Lastly , I think that all these changes wo n't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead of <unk> tedly .
In the supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves .
As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have the access to the information definitely can track him .
It is a common questioned asked by lots of people that as the technology develops and we benefit from it , we are losing our privacy .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
At first the show started at 10.15 , and it should be at 19.30 .
Leasing of private information , even though it only happened one time , but one is too many for an individual .
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yesterday .
The arrival of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you give us , especially in planning all this programme in a such acurate way .
The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people 's wisdom and creativity , which is decreasing due to population aging .
The detective will start investigate the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities .
I know it 's my fault .
So I hope I can help you .
Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments , are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work .
By the way , I would like to know the shopping especially for clothes , I want to buy some for myself .
However , once the government gathers too much power , the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and such surveillance technology provides the measures .
Dear Mrs. Ryan !
So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves .
Instead , when the news of the installment of such device was released in the newspaper , it was heavily criticized by the public .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam
Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research is also widely used in many countries .
Yours sincerely .
Although bank robbers complained to Pat , he said nothing to anybody .
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
In the old times , people could easily lose their life due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
I think that it will be a great opportunity for all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London .
I 'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view , have n't they ?
It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after work .
Dear Kim :
First of all , there was written in the advertisement for the show , that there would be Danny Brook as the main actor , but a different actor played in the show .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
This could cause a drastic fall in their economy as if the younger generation could not take over their work , no one will continue .
One day she looked at me in the eyes with a sharp deep look , Never have I seen such a deep look : and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .
THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRL-FRIENDS .
Does society need surveillance or not ?
What is more modern technology prevents different illnesses .
8 Jun 2000
But there were many things which went wrong .
Despite the huge facilities technology has affected our lives negatively .
First of all the actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
That is to say , people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness .
He promised to keep a secret , in the next morning we had arguiment with Pat , 3 of us were shouting at each other , in shorter Pat went away from us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
There was no discount at all which is in contrast with 'Discount Availabe ' .
However , there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement .
Over the Rainbow , which you advertised .
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how thankful I am .
Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then for shopping in our free time which is on Wednesday ?
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer was !
It may be a challenge but also a golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes .
In my opinion , the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation .
Therefore , every country should try to maintain both young and old generation balanced .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
As people who are incapable of production become more and more , our society follows a downward trend .
Already without these technologies , the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels .
The challenge of many aging countries will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade .
Additionally , the service industry was also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees .
I hope everything is good for your family and your school .
While it becomes highly developed , it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where you go and what did you do .
DEAR , Helen Ryan ,
Climbing , in contrast , is something I started a few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
Yours sincerely,
It 's good that he is far away ... ( or " It 's good that he is far away " )
If you work in a fast-food you can work in the afternoon , or during the night and so you have time for yourself .
First of all , on Tuesday we all will go to the show and spend it all day , but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have free time we can go to the Science Museum if you do n't mind , of course .
But nevertheless I decided to go to your show .
Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
It took quite a long time to adjust to the multi culture in the language institute .
Above are all the information you asked , however , here are something I 'd like to know ; first is about the clothes , what kind of clothes I need to take with ?
Tracking people is one way of abuse technology and in fact , it happened every day .
By comparing to the past , it is a big step forward in development of medical science .
Only in this way can we get evidence of a bad movement to protect others .
I will give you some information which helps you to know me better .
This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose .
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information .
Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable .
Even though we could make a trip to Paris during the school holiday !
So , in the following , I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies .
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago .
Is there some possibility to rent the gold shoes ?
Some people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performances .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for society , this society may lack labours .
I would be very grateful if I could get my money back .
They have a full control of their own lives .
In addition , Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which mainly consists of services .
However , this rising life expectancies have become a challenge and also an achievement in the population ageing .
which is special place in the town we lefet just for comerical area , but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket , and mall centre in different areas of the city .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life .
ON THE WHOLE , I WOULD HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
Without the agreement , people should not be able to use this technology to track others .
PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY .
Logistics and transportation are major areas of utilization for RFID technology .
I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me .
By this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion .
As far as camp activities are concerned , I have been windsurfing for 5 years , for that reason , I am fairly interested in sailing .
Since this is happening more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Because the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly has increased while that of the youth has decreased .
However , the world is always beyond our imagination and never let us down .
We need a CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious .
In addition , old people are weakened in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as labors .
Without doubt , surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people 's information without getting their permission .
We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed most .
Normal people 's privacy needs the government seriously considered about .
Moreover , the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point .
The police seize the criminal thanks to CCTV .
It was my day , I am sure about it .
First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play .
Best wishes .
Humanity can be the best seen in pets rearing .
ANYHOW EVERYBODY SHOUD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
Dear Mr. RR,
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the organization staff and besides every day I was at the back-stage supporting the catering staff .
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store .
People will act as if there is no supervision .
Thank you for your last entry .
To pay this extra money , the government will exert higher taxed on the other people .
No matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just did n't live a long life .
The aging problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies .
RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking .
This survey evidently shows that a big achievement has been made in the medical area and people 's living standard has improved .
Although the rising of life expectancies is a challenge to the entire human nation , the detailed problems each country that will encounter is different .
I hope to hear from you soon .
Food can be a big part of our lives .
I look forward to hearing from you .
When people start to age , many diseases will surface up unnoticed .
However , when it happens , it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labor to society .
I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival . '
We think it is a great opportunity to see the latest fashion , find about making up and hairstyles .
In other words , it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective , well-managed by the Government .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
We could n't drink .
I have just received the letter , which lets me know that I have won first prize .
I was sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
Pat did n't say anything .
Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - are making different things .
This technology leads to a problem which is same as the prisoner issue that is human privacy .
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon .
First of all , because of the big variety in the store .
Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
The pop band <unk> <unk> Five '' arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound .
Cancers , as a major group of killing diseases , is often beyond current medication to get fully healed .
So if I could travel in July , and come back before the 6th of August , that would be great .
Especially the sightseeing by bus seems to be very interesting .
I must say that the International Arts Festival is a really great idea .
I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer .
Can you imagine ?
This leads to an escalation of your anger .
Many people , especially women , love shopping .
We spent hours till it was good enough for the Technical-manger .
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .
Therefore , we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us .
However , I 'm happy that we finished this hard work .
And did you notice something about the fashion of the future ?
The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .
So , you could understand how disappointed I was .
In the United States , after the horrible attack on September 11 , the US congress passed the Patriot Act , which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance , to counter against the terrorists .
Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for a long time rather than training freshman .
The application of surveillance technology is the most effective method to track people and thus can help the police a lot .
I 'll be looking forward to hearing from you .
Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly .
I hope you will continue making your festivals .
The fourth day , the singers and the players have been there to test .
Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said .
I think I ca n't forget this experience in my mind
See you soon .
Third , there was no possibility of a discount .
I had enjoyed seeing the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago ; and the actor 's Danny Brook performance .
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in society and the portion of working adults has decreased .
It is the technology developments enable the improvement of the living conditions ; the discovery of the food and the nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for human to absorb ; various medicines that can cure different diseases .
Therefore , achieving such great fret , in these areas is considered an achievement where human lives is then improved and extended the life of us .
Think about it .
If a famous person does n't mind in being filmed in his personal life there 's no problem .
My parents are very kind , and they know that their son will do everything right .
Everyday crimes are happening from time to time , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .
Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .
I hope you understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .
After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .
Ma .
2 .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she almost killed but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
Unfortunately , we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre .
Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up .
I also like taking photographs , for example during my journeys or trips .
With best wishes , your student .
So , what are we going to do ?
Tuesday 13th , June , 2000
Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
THIS PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
From my point of view , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine , TV , cook and the light , connecting to the owner .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
There are also some older people who live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
I was very nervous talking with him .
So , that 's everything that I can tell you , I enjoy a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .
Because I did n't have any plans I decided to have lunch in a theatre restaurant .
It is understandable that once people have human implants , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out .
One day , I fell in love with my closest friend .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contribute to our scientific findings and research .
Under the products tags , children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant .
I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor plays in that show .
And with the activities I must chose photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I am doing well in these things .
The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal , violation of freedom and breakdown of safety .
That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided the program and the present , a new gold watch .
However , in countries like China , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets , pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets .
For families , certainly , the burden for young people is becoming heavier .
The percentage of elders is increasing annually according to the United Nations ' projection .
Thank you for the letter you sent recently .
MANUELA BELABBARA
Someone could be injured .
It started at 20<unk> 15 , fourty five minutes later !
Last Monday , I went to the theatre with two friends .
Dear Sir ,
Azami
This kind of problem can you avoid when you look for big halls at the beginning .
Dear Kim
I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great international art festival alone to young people .
I hope you will write again soon .
Believe it or not I put make-up on one famous singer 's face .
There is only 10 % of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers ' den and arrested all of them before they started to harm the poor victim .
Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .
The significance of our existence is to lead a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world .
Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems .
Although some may appear again after a few years different styles are developed .
When checking out , the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly .
Hello girl , how are you doing these days ?
By using this technology reasonably , it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path .
How is your new school and parents ?
The new technology is changing our lives .
BUT THAT DAY , LIKE I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DID N'T REALISE THAT BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT WAY ; SO WHEN I NOTICED IT THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WHERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
which I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing it , I put them back nicely .
I am delighted to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all be paid in advance .
Why did n't you change the name of your advertisement ?
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems as pollution , so we can live better and longer .
With the development of science and technology , surveillance technology is playing its role in people 's lives .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did , but Pat refused to apologize to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : help Maria to get the man that she loved .
I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it would .
Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing ( because I take part in a chorus at school ) and photography .
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life , products such as RFID tracking system have become real .
Yours sincerely,
On the other hand , the aging of Population can also be a challenge to society .
Typically , RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip .
First , the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy led to a nationwide hunger .
But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for practicing climbing and surfing .
At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before .
However , when I went to the theatre , you did n't do anything not only a discount but also apporogize us for dalay of starting a musical .
What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?
Second modern technology helps me in the kitchen .
I am also used to writing exams which are in Polish schools very often .
However , human beings are not animals or any other products , they have their own thoughts and freedom .
People were queued for stuff from the west .
No matter what measures they take , the population still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
These implants and products are also used as surveillance tools .
When appeared in the first car , it was already a great success .
On the one hand Internet is often used for entertainment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education process !
Therefore , the usages of RFID chips were more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required .
However , along with the increase of life expectancies , ageing problems becomes more and more severe .
Therefore , the surveillance technology can not be casually used .
It was really interesting !
We can either step back to maintain the population with some method , or step forward to search for more resources in outer space .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .
A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received .
Dear Mrs. Helen Ryan , ( I think this is what you mean )
Yours sincerely,
I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see cured some illness like cancer , UTH .
Besides , when I bought the ticket , I found out there was not discounts for a ticket , while you wrote the contrary .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation .
However the show started 45 minutes later .
I have got a doubt , it is not very important , but I would like to know if I need any money or all is payed , the kind of clothes I should wear , if the weather is good or bad ... and all the extra information you can send me .
Dear Sir Madam ,
From that , I learnt more about instruments .
One day my mother got a terrible disease .
As technology develops faster and faster during 301 year , people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life .
If there are more young people , then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely .
Dear Sir ,
The shops have a bad opening time .
From my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear , make up , hairstyles , you know ...
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of weather do you have in California ?
In conclusion I want to say that in spite of this , I hope that in the future we will have more and more new inventions and they will stop our disasters and problems .
By getting the track of the suspensors , police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event .
Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved , people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories .
In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to truck people .
Second of all , the play was supposed to start at 19<unk> 30 , but it started at 20<unk> 15 .
Suddenly a murderer happens !
But data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life .
In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping last month ?
Dear Helen :
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION 'S PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
It sounds easy , just for the light .
Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said <unk> <unk> Congratulations for the new baby .
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do Tennis and Swimming .
They deserve to have a private life like any common person .
I 'm not joking , I got his e-mail .
Yours faithfully,
Surprisingly , there were no discounds .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also used as human implant or as a form of products .
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all life , but it is only a little part of it .
However , people tend to express their personal feelings and ideas about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally .
As the amount of stress , the types of food mixed with chemicals and the quality of living in terms of environment were getting worse .
I could n't believe it .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
The internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person .
Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets .
Whlile I was standing on the beach suddenly I heard someone called my name and said that I had to go home , that right , she is my mum .
Therefore , for the welfare of the aging population , more old age hospitals will have to be built .
In conclusion , what I have mentioned above , we have to agree , the tracking system has many benefits in different parts of life , especially in this modern world .
The idea of democracy and power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked .
Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer .
However , some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
Otherwise , could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for the food , please ?
Two days after , when Pat came back to my school and she met Mr Harter , our head teacher , and she told everything about Ann1 .
I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
Thirdly , it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily lives .
You are interested in my last job !
Cheating can be very popular in examinations and stealing will seldom incur punishment .

The show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched .
Therefore , some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
I know , It was difficult and tiring but I enjoyed it a lot .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and called my name and my boyfreind .
Globally , manpower is lacking .
As life could be precious , an ageing population could be an advantage as well as a disadvantage to a particular country .
She was such a wonderful person in our class .
If old people always bring an auto-tracking device , it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Dear Mr. Robertson
The biggest commercial gain in history I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
When I have such feelings , I will feel that I am not belongs to human beings as everyone else any longer , instead , I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others .
EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS ( AND SPEND MONEY ) .
All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer .
First of all , the actors were different from those who were advertised .
First , what clothes should I take with me , secondly .
They form opinions and invent new fashion styles .
Thanks for your last letter ; I knew you would be interested in my experience of helping the pop concert last time , now I will tell you about it .
In addition , the national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .
13,2-1-07
It has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
Dear Sir Madam :
Although I was too nervous , I knew I could do the job well .
We could only buy things from Russia .
So if you do n't want to feel deceived or offended , think twice before you decide to go shopping .
It consisted of stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hack the school software .
Dear Sir ,
On the other hand , people can atrophided of all these inventions .
This is what happened : when I arrived they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery , then the group arrived , we chatted for 15 minutes then they had to go on stage .
Pro , in terms of the intangible aspects such as emotional and mental development of future generations and contribution to a country 's well reputation .
Some people think that to be a famous person is a very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
It is the way that can " using one stone to kill two birds " .
Obviously , rising life expectancies should also be considered a serious challenge .
However , the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere .
Medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive , however , it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as " human beings " , our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom .
She tried to help others when they had a difficult time at school .
Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word <unk> <unk> Stuff vacation '' on the front door after the show .
When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things that should be celebrated , one is red and one is white .
People are needed .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ?
Best regards !
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxurious ones .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before human taking action .
Yours faithfully,
RFID is used in many forms for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
This form of tool does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to an emergency .
And the other one , I think painting will be a good idea ; Painting is one of my hobbies and I 've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it once I have free time .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favorite band .
For the second part , rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
However , whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority .
But the students in our class have seen an adverstisement for the <unk> <unk> London Fashion and Leisure Show '' which 'll take place in Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it .
Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety , but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety .
Secondly , it may be used by criminals .
A suggestion ?
This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government , decreasing birth rates where people could not afford the children expenses of their upbringing and educational fees , that adds on more burdens and worries for the government .
It will be very interesting ... ( It will be very interesting. )
Secondly , the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue .
I went out with him sometimes and we were happy .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harm to someone , people still prefer to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom .
Despite knowing that Pat could n't keep secret but for this time she was confident maybe too .
Lots of students normally have classes in the morning .
Otherwise , there are more and more people staying at the street and destroying the good view of Garden City .
The sun was shining and the wind was blowing like we had imagined .
12-12-00m,
With the development of modern society , people live longer .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Yours faithfully,
First of all , I want to introduce myself .
It was really amazing .
There is needless to doubt that medical technology has enhanced day by day .
I am very well I 'm writing to explain my experience with the pop concert last month .
For example , when I come back home from university and I call my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and fax and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and thing like that .
From the reasons above , we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily life .
First , I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role , but he had never shown up that night .
Since the inventory management is very important for some kind of company , this technology is playing a very significant role .
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes we should bring .
With the existing of experience , we can do the work more quickly without sacrifice the standard and quality .
I can know what is happening in different parts of the world in a few minutes .
Therefore , when the era is improving itself , the disease does it too .
To make matters worse , the time that the show started was delayed .
Sooner or later , the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed .
With this letter I want to show you some problems I had last week in your theatre with your show .
In ancient times , due to the less development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their health .
We arrived on time but the musical show was delayed until half-pass eight .
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing , because I am used to practicing them with my father since I was a child .
I had to buy a <unk> 20 ticket .
It was unbelievable and tiring as well .
He will be in prison for 5 years .
On the other hand , due to the track of people , the police can better know a person 's daily schedule .
In 1712 , Watt renovated the steam machine which increases the efficiency of the fuel .
tips to earn money
However , while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population aging .
Nowadays , the improved human technology online is able to track different locations for different people .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
Would you please return our money back ?
Compared to technology today and the past , we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable , the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases .
I could n't concentrate on the play any more .
Nowadays , we make a phone call with an astonish rapidity , instead at my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
I 'm writing to You in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival .
but it is not easy , because all is very interesting to me .
Medical expenses , EPF and accommodation are the costs which are directly involved to the old people .
Secondly , I will discuss the aging population as an achievement where they implement healthy lifestyles and good eating habits .
In the camp I can practise them a lot .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
She entered the room , and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR !
I was just walking down by the dressing room manager said that if I could help them .
I phoned the police and told the whole story .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show and it is free for students .
I heard them talking behind the stage .
During the year 2003 , surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevented the spread of the epidemic situation .
So the main rule in our school is regarding the teachers .
I could n't go back to the class so I went home .
For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece .
The technology is growing and growing .
All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls are interested in fashion and make up , so we are expecting the show will be a great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like .
I 'm not used to wasting my time sitting on a chair waiting , but I do have better things to do with it .
The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , and tape recorders .
Now I have to go , write soon and let me know what you have been doing .
Shadow was made in the children 's heart and there is nothing we can do to make up for it .
An example of making a good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path , where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people need a proper concrete walking path and build one at a randomly location .
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school 's floors is not a nice sight , so we change our schoes without questioning that rule .
Well , I have to go now .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam
Anyway , home is always the place to go because it is ours we feel safe and comfortable .
If there are less young people and more old people , as in both Singapore and China , when elderly retirement , there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions .
For example , intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers .
There is a Chinese saying that goes , " Jia you yi lao , ru you yi bao " .
In that case , they would have no choice but to seek for the power of loyal police .
There is one more advantage : it is free for students .
It was incredible .
Second , the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society .
Dear Mrs. ,
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .
Moreover , we had n't any disscount for beeing students .
As elderly people , they need more money for health care than the younger .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person .
I was there , I saw it .
In other words , the government originally hopes to use the tracking system to ensure citizens safety , now it has been divulged with human information .
Thanks very much , because it is a new stimulation for me .
We an on and off the lights with touch pads and remote controllers .
In conclusion , the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like a lack of young generation .
The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie
17th June 2000
I do not agree with this kind of behavior , because humans are different from goods , can not treat humans as goods .
After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there were n't enough drinks .
All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges on the way of meeting expectancies .
Even when the disaster comes , we can restore the order of our lives in a relatively short time than before .
With regard to the date of the trip , July will be best because in June I 'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins .
For the whole society , rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , a better social environment and a safer world .
I once had this problem .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-living paced livings , this can be a double-edged sword .
Okay do n't wait , where you 're good at and begin .
But we would like to suggest you something : There is a trendy event about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear ; make up and hairstyles on the 14th of March .
We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .
I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address .
All her friends were amazed at her change and started trusting her at once .
!
The only time that is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
In fact you try to get a present to make you happy .
Besides tags into human body , there is also the issue of implant into products .
It is a break-through of technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I was going to markets to schools and I was giving information when and where the group was going to appear as well as where they could buy or book tickets for this concert .
I am writing to complain about the show , <unk> <unk> Over the Rainbow '' which I saw in your theatre last week .
A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money .
Dear Sir-Madam The Circle Theatre manager
With the glory , there are some problems .
No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system .
If you really want to hear about school rules in my country , I 'll try to write about them in a nutshell .
This step needs the ability to take a long time of research to make it possible .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .
Ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left what will be the life of our next generation .
What do you expect about the future ?
People 's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury , thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man 's life .
Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum .
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW .
In my point of view , surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions .
Some concert halls were too small and often people could n't see the performances .
Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people .
With the population aging problem getting more and more serious all over the world , the shortage of various kinds of resources challenge most of the countries in the world .
In addition , now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancies , it will lead to a resource problem .
I was absolutely embarrassed and I wanted to run out of the class .
I 've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions .
What should really be put into close surveillance is the government .
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them .
On the other side , we have to say that obvious problems that we face are also caused by the rise of life expectancy .
The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very important , the lack of medicine .
I would like to do it again in the future .
Second , the show started at 20<unk> 15 , and I read that it started at 19<unk> 30 !
It gives the police a better control of the criminal .
Based on the identifiable environment , a lot of convention way or style of human life can be changed .
I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told everything about Lynne Harter , our new collegue at school .
We are all extremely excited especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we were always interested in .
This gives credits to the government 's medical and healthcare schemes .
But we never know !
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much .
Another complaint is about the time that the musical show started , the advertisement said it started at 19<unk> 30 , but it did not , we had to wait 45 minutes .
Rising life expectancies could be seen as a good or a bad trend to others .
I would like to explain to you my experience because I want you to give my money back .
I believe that the event was good , however I feel that the festival can improve next year .
Finally , the concert was exactly what people expected .
I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre .
I do not agree with the above statement .
Even though I could meet some friends , I could n't express my heat to them for we have different backgrounds and our first language were different .
I 'm allowed to do many things at home .
Say , a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month .
They can be thrown away after wearing it and light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change your wearing .
It was absolutely fantastic .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have authors from .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress in modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population .
I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it .
It is undeniable that technology has made our lives and works easier and more efficient .
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling , customer treats with order '' .
I would be grateful if you give a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show .
When there was a restful we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late .
This tracking will help scientists to better get their results and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back .
Circle Theatre in London
Many science fictions have made good efforts in describing a future of human in which every body in society is put under close surveilliance of the governments .
Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is raised up by younger generation .
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husband too .
The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Moreover , the band was exhausted about this great laser show at the end .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
For using as a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which happen or will happen .
For example , they 'll wear a cloth which protects themselves from air pollution , sunshine etc .
It was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion .
ul
How has modern technology change my daily life ?
However there are some problems that I hope to solve .
And what about money ?
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for a good programme which provides us for 3 days stay in London .
Companies are in trouble if they can not earn sufficient money to sustain their business and they also need to pay high taxes to the government .
So I told her everything about my life .
After the concert I only helped with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .
Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find .
I have n't got my mobile phone with me and I was half way between my school and home .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either , at least everyone in my family likes my work , including myself .
13th June 2000
Yours faithfully,
It was a fantastic experience .
If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes , by hacker technology , they can use the government tracking system to do their own business .
This would be a great opportunity because we are all interested in clothes , sports and fashion .
This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and the violent movement could be launched onto one with the aid of tracking tag or implant .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening our lives .
When a person grows old , the medical needs of a person increase over the years relative to the age of a person .
For instance , in the militaries which are of high importance , surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidence if anything is fault .
Firstly , surveillance technology is useful in crime investigation and public issues .
Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .
By following the trend of improvement in technology , people can now easily tracked by using RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) by simply implant a RFID tags on human body .
So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting .
Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme : starring !
These changes and damages also increase the chances of contacting more illnesses as we age .
Well , I think that is all .
However , they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves .
And that is what we are striving for .
Why do people like going shopping so much ?
Also , please advise for any necessary things to prepare and bring .
Some of us have been living in one house since they were born .
So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age .
THOUGH WE DONT HAVE SHOPPING AND FREE TIME .
In another word , there are more elders who have lower productivity and more medical problems compared to younger people in this world population .
Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology
Actually , my mind has already gone there , I ca n't wait even for a minute .
The advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth is also a big challenge .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society .
You ca n't imagine how much I enjoyed that journey .
In the first place , rising life expectancy could cause resources challenge .
When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people .
Dear Mrs. Ryan
We like to go on July , because my wife Catrin just has holidays next month .
And what do you think I answered ?
For this part , not only the privacy problem is concerned , but human health .
The government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
Therefore , this technology carries a great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared .
I came second last year 's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes .
I am going to stay here for a week .
The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .
One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip .
People should have to take a license to drive those things .
Dear Mr. Robertson .
They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian .
Thus , we should not compare now with the past but we need to worry about the future problems that caused by this situation .
I have a really good , friend , Pat who I was trusted and counted on her .
Parents also can ensure the safety of children as well as do not endanger their privacy .
In a Chinese kindergarten , children were always abused by a teacher but no one else knows that .
And years later it enabled me to get a very good job .
Dear Mrs. <unk> Ryan .
After they release from the prison , the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though .
We trusted him .
We can think about this scenario : the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second .
I would like to know only in July because I have set my holidays this month since last January .
I hope to have a chance to practice both of theme at 'Camp California ' .
We became passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-conscious , this system can prevent them from losing .
One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime .
This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want to get money and in the meantime they have to study .
It happened 3 months ago , and during this month I was very upset .
Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .
This ability is not seen 40 years back where the technology advances were not as good as now .
Also , it was certain that I bought a discount ticket because I am a student .
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
It made me a bit angry .
Propably in the future we might be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
Love , and
All students will be very grateful .
Dear Kim ,
During my 2 week holiday I would like to attend a musical show .
It was absolutely different from your leaflet .
I was punished , nearly expelled , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Definitely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back .
On the other hand what will happen to us in the future ?
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp .
At that time he was unconscious , I kept asking myself 'should I wake him up or try to use my unsure first aid skill to deal with him .
Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on the development of medication .
Rising Life Expectancies , Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
Thirdly , we were astonished about the actors who we knew from others musical .
Children are given birth by their parents ; parents are responsible for taking good care of them .
I will give you all necessary information .
Will we need any special clothes and how much you would suggest me to carry for these two weeks ?
The last day , in fact the concert was absolutely fantastic .
Sometimes , they are happy to go shopping .
But , I was wondering , like a student of this college , if we would change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
If so , then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like .
On the other hand , there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily lives .
You know !
There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable ' and who is happy only when can go shopping .
Once such a chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals , all the information about his or her life can be recorded .
About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are cleaner than the tents .
As you know I 'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do many more different things apart from studying my A-level history , such as meeting up my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .
I was displeased from the very beginning , because I expected to get a discount as a student .
After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
As you say in your advertisment it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
But the most exciting part was meeting the band , mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good-looking .
In addition we would like to thank you for the programme .
Dear Mr. Robtson !
Therefore , the increase in life expectancy is also a great challenge .
Above all , the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of society .
In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority .
That evening which should be my perfect evening out , was in fact very tiring and boring .
So , we have a future in our hands !
WHEN THEY CLOSED I TOOK THE 7 BUS .
It was closed because of the staff training .
You might spend too much money and buy something you do n't really need .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fasinative in art and enjoyed taking photographs of wildlife .
I 'M SINCERLY ;
Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a monitor , otherwise the teachers ' actions can not be supervised .
In the last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
People in the current era are described as demanding or having a high level of life expectancies in another word .
Maybe that 's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate .
You offered something impossible to do .
By the rate of environmental damage , we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being had to be changed .
First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only month for me to go .
There is one thing is common in the world described in many fiction - chips are implanted in human and record its location , history and even thoughts at that time .
By projections of the United Nations , it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2 % to 3 % in the developed and developing countries respectively .
Something that I note about technology is that we are losing green places and there is a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
We also have five computers , the latest versions of them , because they are useful for my father to work and for me to do some special work for University .
This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particular for the small children who are studying in a nursery .
Some socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned .
However , as the population is aging , the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized .
We have to consider more about our future generation , aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges .
I did n't have a computer until I was eight .
Just after Scala told her the new , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell that Scala is pregnant .
Children play wit computers instead of usuall plays .
Because I did it for the first time .
Never have to leave the house or wake up so early .
I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future .
As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , how to make life easier , comfortable as well as healthy has been shed light on .
We are a little afraid , what kind of clothes and shoes we have to take off with us ?
This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people .
Dear Madam ,
Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID cards .
As the fast growing of electrical technology , people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of it .
I would like to travel to camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
At the end you said it will be a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything until we got home .
It was a Friday Sunday afternoon , Scala was really excited to tell her the new .
I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE THING HAD .
Why did n't you say something about it ?
Judging from the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters , human traffickers , and the yukuza from his book , it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human taking opportunity on this marvelous tracking technology .
Since this may happen across the province , and without any clue about the path that the child may go through .
Rising life expectancies can be a pro to the family 's affairs .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come from .
However , if the child has been installed with a tracking device , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used in voluntary bases .
However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend .
We should n't allow it to exploited the world .
Dear Kim ,
Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays .
The same situation happens around the world .
And of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like .
I 've never been to the <unk> <unk> before so I think it 'll be an exciting trip .
Furthermore , by telling the geographical position of the people , RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims .
Pat , Maria 's best friend
In addition , could you advise me on how much money I need for the trip ?
The current result is increasing the size of the population .
As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our quality of life but also violating our right of privacy , I think we should not use it to truck people .
Surveillance technology : A prospering technology
Social networks such as facebook ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised .
I appreciate this shops for lots of products , cheap prices end big spaces .
In the late nineteenth century , there was a severe air crash happening at Miami International Airport .
Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you have n't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop .
However , the aging population is a phenomenon opposite to it .
In this mean time , surveillance technology is founded which means that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere .
But it 's life , destiny , very cruel destiny ... But it 's life , destiny , and very cruel .
The criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved .
Please , if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake .
I apologize for this .
You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price .
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls , for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .
We know we are going for three days , but we 'll have enough time to use one of the bigger cities in the world .
If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but do not grant access to them to its senior citizens , it just does not help .
I 'm a beginner at both activities .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 'm sorry but I am very disappointed with the musical show .
First , food resources and medication resources are the most important to support the living human beings .
Well here in Dublin things still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the moby concert here at the point which is the big theatre for events and concerts , I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard , do you who was there ?
I would prefer living in tents to log cabins .
I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were planning to do .
However , in this very non-ideal world where corruption is an abundance , wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous , perverted and deadly weapon .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me , about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
As for transportation , roads and traffic authorities can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
He was not a DANNY BROOK .
We must accept that media have an important effect in our lives in special the T.V .
Secondly , surveillance technology can decrease the illegal actions effectively .
So I 'm now writing to let you know how grateful it was .
The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of this species .
People are able to predicate some disasters like the earthquake and do the prevention beforehand .
In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be an obligation in the future .
More interestingly , this technology is being used in human identification , even planting the chip into human body .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
Because I believed that this was a result which came with my help .
If a country can bear a aging population , it is a thing that the country can be proud of .
Actually , this technology is very useful and should definitely be used .
Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .
Expansion of population can not continue like that because the resources are limited , and we will end with dying out after using all resources .
However I 've found an e-mail is better than them .
The aim of this report is to make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
However , as there is only limited space and resource on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide .
I open my e-mail every night .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy , we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
It became difficult to do my homework .
Do you think you 've had the future in your hands ?
Nevertheless , the provision of more medicine and better equipment as well as more medical centre is necessary to accommodate these elders .
Dear Mr. Robertson
Home sweet home .
I am waiting for a satisfactory answer .
For example , the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally .
During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who ca n't find toilet , and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
In conclusion , the reason why population aging is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of global medical science .
In a car accident related to an official 's relative , the record was modified with a new record .
Medical advances which help in curing this illness were also getting better over the year which helps in the rise in life expectancy .
That will also cause more social concerns .
The temperature will be cooler to sleep than the cabin .
I was promised that the stars were Danny Brock but when I was there I saw just other stars that were completely different from your brochure .
It is very good for us but I think we should think more carefully when we buy something for our children .
We are sentimental and we have memories from the past .
The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it .
It shows , when all members of a group work hard together , you can reach a lot .
When mentioning about the population aging , the media always considers it as a social problem .
I think that if my mother had gotten ill ten years before , she would n't have survived .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helping engieners tested the lights .
Especially , a computer has made my daily life change dramatically .
So I decided to choose climbing and photography .
Dear Sir !
The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwide .
Dear Mr. Mr.
Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step .
IT SAID : 'DANNY BROOK ' .
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one was n't good at all .
Firstly , it was a good break from the routine .
So I would like to get back our money .
From the point of humanity , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings .
It was such disappointing .
This is a great achievement made by the generation .
It is more like a prisoner 's life , because we are under other people 's control and we can do nothing to change our situation .
Dear Mrs. <unk> Ryan .
The advanced technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away .
Since there are more people on Earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
For the first part , rising life expectancy is a challenge .
Thanks !
Furthermore , knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .
Actually , not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling , RFID can defend human beings from harm .
In some fields , Surveillance technology did have brought us tremendous benefits and advantages .
31 Sea State
Due to the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate , the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger .
Actually , I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident about it .
However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watches or clothes , it did provide convenience in a certain situation .
For instance , face book as well known social media platform has the ability to tracking someone 's location .
Shopping is also good , when you know what you want .
Should I take some money with me ?
It is clear that population aging is happening all over the world , since the current average life span is 65 and the population above the age of 60 is increasing year after year .
Furthermore , in August I will be preparing for my course at the University which I am starting next September .
The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret policies .
Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality .
As regard as the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to practise painting and photography .
This is the result of better quality of life ; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitations and advanced health-care .
For example , it could be installed in personal lockers to record other 's moves and actions .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Much media has reported the effective measures of installing surveillances in Singapore .
Dear Sir Madam :
Yours sincerely ,
In your last letter you asked me about the concert ... oh it was fantastic !
July is hot .
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly , and with the help of the police office , maybe they can find the elderly back , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
Population ageing : A more and more attention-getting topic
As our society develops , the people have a much higher living standard , which will reduce the chance of getting disease .
You can not lose time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
As a result , the government needs more taxed from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people .
Another point is to go to a big area .
If there had been a monitor in the classroom , maybe parents and headmaster could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier .
I am looking forward to your answer .
I had never sat down there before .
I would prefer to stay in tents because since I was a child I have been using this type of accommodation .
Yours faithfully,
Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what it includes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living in .
The challenge is how many lives can society and community afford to sustain ; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
which was unusual before .
Dear Mr. ,
Yours sincerely,
I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on June 6th .
In the opposite , shopping can be disenjoyable .
Billy Esposito
Then try to invent new energy and legitimately control the birth rate , then developing medical treatment and paying enough attention , we have reasons to trust , population aging will not be a problem at all .
First of all because I have never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .
However , the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in the invasion of privacy .
Instead , owing to CCTV , telephone and other RFID , we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone , but we seldom notice it , that is why it is horrible to our life .
And they will use soft cozy clothes like cotton and silk .
For individuals , since people 's life expectancies are becoming longer , there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .
It may be in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately .
For example , a wanted person can escape easily from a country and hide in another country with this method .
45-139 Warsaw
Sincerely yours
With the population aging and the increasing portion of the old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
Finally , please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring ?
During the less developed times , due to disasters like droughts , floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths , people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time .
My boy friend was very handsome , clever and very polite .
But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just one day and I could feel different emotions .
13th June 2000
To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in tents , that 's in my opinion a way to be nearer to the environment and the animals , although I do n't mind living in log cabins .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles etc .
How many times have we heard people complain about shopping ?
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you organised for our trip to London .
We could change Tuesday 's programme to Wednesday .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work , my current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping .
However , people who are taking security jobs assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier .
And my answer to the question of which activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming because it is my daily exercise and surfing .
13- 2000
I used to go to snowboarding .
While I 'm stayin there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
They were all sold out .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
However , if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently .
In the staff you can also find young people and have fun with them during the work .
Finally , I am considering what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need .
As technology increasingly advances , many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles' .
Surprisingly , none of these are describing the future as a bright one .
I 'd prefer staying in log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study .
After your show I wanted to visit my friends , and because of that , I did n't do it .
Thank you very much for your letter. I was glad to get it and know a lot of news about you .
No discounts were available .
So we would like to suggest to you how the programme could be changed .
I 'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with you !
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase our planet capacity .
I was very hungry and tired .
I 've always loved music so much that the concert was great .
The older people the country has , the more experience they will be as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and making them not make the same mistakes as them .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
On the other hand , rising life expectancies could bring some achievements .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thanks .
Juanita Fabiola Martin
IT IS VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA , WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change .
Maybe the eason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
We are building a new house for our family .
Dear Mr. Smith,
With an increasing age , people become more prone to disease and injury , and more difficult to recover .
Firstly , security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace .
If failed to fulfil this requirement , this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the societal or company working groups .
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have chosen is International Commerce or Market .
I would prefer tents because I have never stayed in tents before and I am wondering how it is going to be like And among these activities I am choosing basketball and swimming .
Dear Kim ,
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets that why our great plan for holiday was not real .
Thirdly , I am very interested in swimming and also climbing .
The activities I would like to do are climbing and surfing .
It was a nightmare !
When I feel comfortable shopping everything will be closed or you wo n't have enough time to look around .
In front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime .
13th June 2000
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing .
THERE IS GOING TO BE THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW ON THE 14TH OF MARCH , FROM 10.00 TO 19.00 .
But not in the strange way you can imagine ... I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars by aereoplanes ...
Finally , could you tell me what I need to dress and how much money I will spend on .
I would also like to know about my two hobbies : swimming and surfing .
Finally what kind of weather is waiting for us ?
Nowadays , people use an all-purpose smart phone for communicating .
Some years , there is a report on Hong Kong citizens living situation , in a small room there are eight people , they can not do anything in the room , only can sleep and the air in the room is very bad .
I finished my classes on the 25th of June and August is for going with my parents to France .
Some people think RFID should be banned for privacy consideration .
Actually , we can cure illnesses which were very dangerous before .
Yours sincerely,
Travelers survive in the desert thanks to the GPS guide them .
It represents a query : is not everyone can view each other 's information such as name and age ?
Can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget .
You must control your behaviour and try not improve so much yourself .
Have a good time .
I had a week holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was the worst evening in my life .
That sounds like we are naked in front of the public , there is no secret and even privacy for us .
Last week I went shopping with my younger brother .
First of all , technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
and unbelievably , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
!
These few problems were taking a toll in human lives over the years when they were over 60 years of age .
I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government , the society 's balance is broken .
The most appreciated thing was they 've given me their latate CD with signature .
It was written too that there were discounts available and I asked for them and they said to me that they were n't allowed to do any discount .
With the development of society , of the past thousands of years , the technology is progressing and the concern for health is rising , so that higher life expectancies are achieved .
The children told their parents .
Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work forces because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person .
An example is the modern method of intensive farming .
I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT ALL .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
These small things makes the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .
Just imagine the way people live in the future .
There are a lot of reasons that could be awful to go shopping .
Rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living has improved for the majority of people .
PEOPLE , WHO DO N'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS OF THIS SITUATIONS ( MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP-ASSISTANCE , BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT HAVE TO DO IN SHOPS ) .
Secondly , the starting time has been changed from 19<unk> 30 to 20<unk> 15 .
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS WHOLE AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
I would like you to back my money because that was not the same as your advertisement .
Fortunately , today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else he wants !
I prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in tent because I am not used to small spaces and feel more comfortable with a place like a bedroom .
Secondly , language ability was another issue .
And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started .
I am writing to complain about the musical show .
Therefore , the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary .
I think that the track can be saved in some places which are not open to the public .
And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read through my letter .
Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future , hence to save more lives .
I would like to refund some money back .
From now on I do n't want to tell something secrets to Pat because she always tells someone else but she is still my best friend .
As a result , the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now .
It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they did n't want to wait for my help ; so they went around the theatre , looking for their seats and making so much noise .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
All I ought to do is buy and choose .
<unk> Kana Najee
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market lots of private shops , markets and super-markets .
All work I needed to do was n't very interesting .
Their purchasing power is low .
Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened .
It made me so disappointed and angry .
13th June , 2000
EVENTHOUGH YOUR PROGRAM IS PERFECT WE WILL PREFER TO GO THERE .
Yours sincerely,
Because as soon as I send my message , they can receive it .
Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students .
I 've read your advertisement and it did n't say the truth .
In spite of that , a smart phone is still a device that needs to be recharged its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object .
However , it is not easy to get a refund or to change them .
How could we appreciate the show properly ?
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention .
First of all , I think that I will help them .
The surveillance is a useful method to keep society 's safe , but also kills the privacy of people in some degree .
For example when it is rainy , because then everything gets wet .
I hope you find my opinion useful .
My first question is about clothes ; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us ?
I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge concert whose singer was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag ' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man 's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Ms. MARIA AROZ
When he went back to his house , his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it was n't a surprise !
At the beginning , I would like to thank you .
I really wanted to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies .
Write me soon and take care .
All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to the track general population for the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority .
Open some foreign language classes at part-time for the students who are interested in it .
This means that having an elderly at home is equivalent to having a gold at home .
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medication and people 's living conditions .
Pat found a great place for the party called <unk> <unk> Blue Box '' .
All moves of us are easily tracked .
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .
And there are few questions I would like to ask about .
Perhaps , he moved into another town .
The day one consisted of the festival 's place with fences .
How to hear from you
I 'm really good taking pictures , it 's a way I have to express my feelings .
In conclusion , the rising life expectancy can be considered both challenge and achievement .
On one hand , if there are less young people and more old people , a lack of work force problem will arise .
I decided to do something to this man , my first move was to check was there any solid or liquid which could block his breath .
I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and best city to appreciate it .
Secondly , there was a delay which got me into trouble , after the show I could n't catch my train .
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOUSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DID N'T KNOW VERY WELL THE AREA BECAUSE ALL TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF IN THE COURNER OF MY HOUSE .
Thank you for your letter and your congratulations .
This already raises up a problem of privacy .
For example , if the one who carries the reliable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location , he or she can disable the track .
As requested , I visited some classes during the lesson and some other rooms while activities were taking place .
To make the matter worse , I was travelling to London to see this famous starring but I did n't see any shows of them .
Competition Organiser
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings .
Every day when I opened my door and went to the lady 's through the corridor , I was recorded by 3 CCTV .
And now will be the first winner .
So the population is getting older .
I often like getting gifts for my relatives and friends .
I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at University and at the moment I do not know the exact date .
Yours sincerely,
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking through shelves and not finding that in the end .
Therefore I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mentioned above .
The rising of life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement when the problems of humans can be medically disturbing .
The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only from six countries .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon as shown in China , India , Europe and even more countries and regions .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement but it poses more challenges to the government and people .
The real show on it owns is really very different to what is mentioned in the advertisement .
People will be able to adjust and change times .
I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and I had to pay for a normal price .
Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe .
Famous people are special for the rest of society .
Even if I like to shop with some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time .
They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health to a better condition .
With the help of the video surveillance , the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased .
In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time , it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities .
So , now my best friend is a prisoner .
I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible .
Definitely , I want my money back as soon as possible .
He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .
After the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this has n't been said before .
First , it was because of the cultural difference .
Otherwise , the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered down when the time passes or people should lower their expectations of life .
Dear Kim ,
If there is some controversy , how it can be improved .
What 's worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
I will write soon .
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance , the chance for them to follow rules and orders is high .
Furthermore , to make living , many senior citizens go back to work .
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement in the newspaper .
Second , it started only at 20<unk> 15 .
The increasing longevity is due to the fast development of the society so as the living pressure .
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody could find you .
The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer front of the scene , to avoid the people coming on the concert floor .
Most of the illness lies with mental illness , musculoskeletal pain , sight and hearing loss .
It 's like , walking in the clouds , you feel like you 're flashing .
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was 'Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour later .
In crime investigation , the truth of evidence is necessary , which can only be made by photos , videos or small tracks .
Con , on the other hand , in terms of tangible aspect mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world .
Especially for families .
To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system .
Basketball is the game which I love .
At first I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do so in a hurry or for duty .
It may be known that young children may be robbed by some agency that doing the business to trade the children .
and of couse as you have seen it I 've given one to you .

I JUST BE YOURSELF
In this essay , I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should be used or not to track people .
It is unacceptable for some people in society , however , I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit .
Sometimes I think that people never grow up , if they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise !
I 'm really keen on sports , especially sailing .
Nowadays , humans live in modern society .
ON THE WHOLE , CLOTHES WILL HAVE NO CHANGE .
We have more researchers than some years ago and we will be able to find the solution of lots of problems .
It is also the advance of surveillance technology .
I could n't believe my eyes .
Secondly I believe you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy concerts because some concert halls were too small .
You said that it was a perfect evening out but it was n't like that .
I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another .
We can not deny that Surveillance technology is a great achievement that securing us and protect us from criminals but we also can not ignore the lease of our privacy and even limit our freedom .
Maybe the first impression is n't positive but from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is right for get some money .
And I was helping them fixing the last details .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardware of the system , they do require a software to function , which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
However , as far as I am concerned , using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
Fifty years ago people even did n't think that after 2000 years they would have another life .
I look forward to hearing from you .
In a word , the rise in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings .
Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions are something original and exciting .
The Francis 's secret was discovered !
If we have these technologies , it will automatically confirm that people 's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but it was closed .
You asked me a few questions in your letter .
Valles Co. Cornel
Personally , I wanted to keep serets because I afraid that we might have split up .

This report is aim to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestions about it .
If the spectacle has been beautiful , I would have been quite pleased to wait .
I 'm ok and let me tell you about my last experience .
In spite of that , people should be aware that the power of science is not almighty , life will still go to their last page without revelation .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help regulate human or animal behavior .
A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave ovens .
ul
Yours sincerely,
We know it is easier for these busy lives .
People 's life quality has been better now , in order to continue improving , people have begun to consider how to raise their life .
In the following , I will take Singapore as a case study as a reference to my discussion .
Thank you for your last letter. I was very pleased to receive it .
If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies , it will continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
According to recent research , population aging is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
My life is changing too .
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A .
More over after watching a show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .
Therefore , I need to sleep in a bed .
Now about your questions , it is very difficult for me to give any advice you about it , I do n't know your cousin very well so I do n't know what she prefers reading .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer to the students the best way to spend our time without wasting time in silly places or events .
In addition , I would prefer to stay in a tent .
The Polish supermarket is not a Polish origin shop .
All of us hope to live in a freer , more relaxed and safer world .
Fourth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem .
All the staff for children are at the same level as they have their own eyes .
The most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you , according to the things you like to do .
I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer .
I thank you in advance and looking forward to your reply .
Close surveillance is not only a problem of bad feelings , but also a problem of the health of society .
Finally I met Pat .
You must like it .
So , the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people are living .
It 's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life .
Dear Jack
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO THE ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED .
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as an audience .
After so many children were abused , people came to know the truth .
I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me for an address .
Then , we can go to the show during that period
And your last festival was very interesting too .
We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys .
We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .
I 'm writing to complain for the musical show <unk> <unk> Over the Rainbow '' .
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two weeks travel to Camp California .
The contradiction of the safety and the privacy can not be reconciled perfectly .
First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor .
It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracy .
It 's great to visit especially the Science Museum because of its expositions .
Modern technology has changed my life .
Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
Having the power can help people to achieve lots of things ; however , abusing will guide us in another direction .
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD FOR YOUR ANSWER .
Where filial piety and respect for the elder are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions , the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as for their parents .
I advise you to do something like that .
I thought he was very rude , but I was wrong , he is n't arrogant at all and he looks very simply .
I think also that will be a good idea to take some general plans for the school area as there is a huge background .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's a possibility to see and to love the art , but , I think also there are some things that could be changed .
I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need :
However , such rapid advancement technology can be extremely useful to our daily life ; it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful lives that can be out of our imaginations and estimations .
Many young people do n't view things like their parents used to do .
And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage .
Hence , the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
As different kinds of Farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always seen .
We are all very happy with your programme , especially we like the idea of sightseeing by our and National Art Gallery .
What do they think about it ?
There are other machines which are bad for the environment .
Yours faithfully,
Most things will be computerised .
I would also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the <unk> <unk> is .
We have seen the programme list and we all think it will be enjoyable .
For the first several days , Pat all the time was with us .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
I 'd love to hear all your news , why do n't you come and visit me ?
In the novel 1984 , written by George Orwell , the author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they doing everything .
THEY DO N'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ( SOMETIMES 'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE ) .
Have you ever seen the film star wars ?
Pat was very excited about this .
It is remarkable that the population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually in developing countries as well .
Best wishes
I look forward to hearing from you .
I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around .
Bye !
Would that be fine for you too ?
Imagine that one day , one was suddenly arrested from his normal life by the police and told that he is accused of posting anti-society statements on the Internet .
The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement .
As a result of this , our society has changed a lot .
I 've practised sailing since an early age and I am perfectly able to manage the rigging and sail .
This function can be used in many aspects .
They can maintain social control and recognize threats .
<unk> <unk> THE RIGHT PERSON ''
If pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents , citizens definitely are unhappy being watched by the big brother .
and is there anything else I have to know ?
The question you asked me in it is very original too .
Because sometimes the article for buying is not really necessary .
Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from around the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
Using surveillance technology such as <unk> o-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as identification cards .
I want to thank you for this prize , let me know if you need further information .
Yours sincerely,
Please think about this and give us an answer .
This is the reason why I do not like shopping .
It can also be found in schools and workplaces .
( A very depressing point of view , is n't it ? )
WE THINK IS A GRATE OPORTUNITY , BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW , WE DO N'T HAVE ACCES TO THAT KIND OF SHOWS IN THIS CITY .
Now I can tell you that it was an amazing challenge for me because I never did anything like that .
Actually , the tracking system has provided people safety indemnification .
From internet , email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is advancement to not only the society but also the world 's achievements .
We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students .
We 'd like to thank you because the kind of happening shows how you are dedicated to our school and the students that study there .
First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .
At home I do n't have many rules either .
Trends of society and cultures can therefore be observed as a function of time .
Firstly , the aging population is generally low productivity .
Furthermore , thanks to the development of technology , that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing .
So it 's better not to write anything if you do n't make it true then .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money .
Whereas , for the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
I 'm not sure if I must say technology has changed our life in positive or not .
13th June , 2000
Obviously , rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology , insurance condition , culture development , and our social system , which shows the improvements of people 's life quality .
Finally I just ask you what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me , and around how much money you think I will need .
'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life ? '
In conclusion , surveillance technology is necessary in many public places in my opinion because we need it in crime investigation and social issues .
We could play with our toys , dolls and we could enjoy without a computer .
it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects , but also cause leakage of personal information .
Modern technology is better now than what it used to be .
On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .
Dear Kim ,
In the modern world , many global issues have been appeared like global warming , the concept of earth village and population .
Humankind is not an exception .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert , apart from the musicists and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security service ... it was so exciting !
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power .
Dear Sir
Yours sincerely,
In supermarkets where it is difficult to catch stealers , surveillance technology which makes records that can be replayed or detect stealers on the spot are superior to use .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
Like in the zoo .
For the accommodation , I would prefer the tents because I like adventure and simplicity .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is one type of example that has currently been implemented .
First , our privacy is at threat .
But I have never 'surfed ' in my life , so that is an activity I have to learn .
It was a waste of time .
Studies have shown that the life span is getting longer which reflects the rising of life expectancies .
And I would like to make sure that he really loves me .
Computers might know better than humans , but there are many things which it can not replace in our lives .
I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes .
I THANK HIM SO MUCH , AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED TO THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING WRON HAPPEN TO ME .
In order to celebrate the 125 anniversary of the city , the Coun Council organised an open air concert .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society , including at least advanced health care system , reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
However , it is fairly fragile which can be counter-used by criminals at the current level .
However developed our society is , technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had chance to see most of the performances , that was excellent .
There is only one thing that is different .
I would prefer to stay in tents rather than in log cabins , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .
Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phones by parents .
For example , the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is " the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II " as CNN commented .
Yours sincerely,
At the same time , our location should be protected from seen by strangers .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
Firstly , the population aging can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology .
Firstly , privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring .
Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology .
The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which are brought up by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies can not be simply discarded .
Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Around people , there are full of high technology like CCTVs , automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems .
Then I 'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when I was at Camp California .
This is very hazardous .
Ageing results in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents .
10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
For this kind of situation , RFID will help a lot .
In the movie , the spy agent accesses public street cameras to track Jason 's Borne whereabouts .
It is therefore better to stick to the status quo .
Do you think we 're living like old times ?
At night , Francis was invited to the party at Pat 's home .
Above all , I think we can not ban the use of RFID completely , since it will be of great help for human benefits during scientific exploration , rescue and police events .
There are so many people in the FBI , although it is under strict rules , and we can not think of any ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out .
They were giving two concerts one on Friday and the other one on Saturday they invited me to go on Friday .
Yet , do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement .
Now I would like to have your point of view .
It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down .
Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
In fact , this was the major limitation of people 's average life span in the past .
This will inversely improve the sale of the shop .
In the ancient times , the residents may only live for 30 years ; but now , the life expectancy can be in the 80s in many countries .
With the developing of modern society , more and more new technology appears and people 's life qualities rise because of new inventions .
Health care by far has been expensive to carry out .
His friend is able to upload his location to this advanced technology .
At the same situation for climbing I need special equipment and then there are available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities ?
Finally , everyone should decrease their own life 's rhythm .
I want to go there now .
How are you ?
I paid for the show £ 50.00 I also have a recite to prove it .
This was scheduled 3 months ago .
Dear Mrs. <unk>
Here I am , writing you to tell everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
My life now is exposed to lots of CCTV .
Lots of love,
Moreover , if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes , then the location of one will be revealed every second .
After hard work we want to go home to have our corner where we are all able to rest and relax .
The aging population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most developed countries .
We will have free time on Wednesday afternoons .
I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I won first prize .
I am very disappointed because the things that were written on the advertisment were not really true .
I had a great time that day .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was successful and every day was crowded .
The increasing population requires more medical sources since elders need more medical attention .
I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
In addition , corrupted officials may sell this tracking information to the mafia .
At present time , people are more concerned about their health .
Technology has developed increasingly in recent years .
Imagine when people camping in the forest or hills , they will just lose all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone runs out of batteries .
With a low birth rate , Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country .
However , tracking people are difficult and different from goods .
I can stay at Camp California in the <unk> <unk> for two weeks .
Dear Kim ,
Another point where you can improve is when you show more plays and films next year .
I had to pay full price .
We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources .
This machines are connected to Internet , and it gives to my family too much facility to get every information we want , from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday 's football match .
We can buy everything that we imagine .
We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depending on a sound legal system , and it means surveillance has its own restriction .
Modern technology has changed a lot in our daily lives .
Finally , I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity .
WE ARE REALY INTERESTING IN THIS SHOW .
As your questions , I am free to travel only on July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement .
I was so happy to hear that I have won a two week holiday in the U.S.A .
Oh , I forgot about it !
Nowadays , this technology has been used in many kinds of fields , such as transportation and logistics , transportation payment , product tracking and inventory systems , some institutions and so on .
Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescue and police events , the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results .
Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on the matter .
Then technology can reach any place in the world easily .
Besides , if RFID is supposed to be used by the public , everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family .
Yours faithfully,
Yours sincerely
Observers are likely to go into rural forests or mountainous areas .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your letter again .
Thanks for your attention .
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
I am writing to ask about your advertisement and a theatre show .
Firs of all the Internet gives you an access to a great number of different information .
However , as life expectancy rises , some social challenges occurred as well .
We prefer the last two weeks in July .
In modern digital world , electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as Smart phones , computers and etc .
If looking after children does n't fit you , you can try with pets .
I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny !
The atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The benefits of surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS , and this is a success example of the surveillance .
I told her everything about my boyfreind and when we were met each other and suddenly we were falling in love .
I look forward to hearing from you
However , with respect of civil rights and privacy , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) shall not be used to track people .
I selected swimming because it is a cure against my backace and I have not practiced since I started my new job five years ago .
And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .
Firstly , I have had no discount at paying .
All the time I am thinking about Peter .
It was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
If the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people , it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less , the productivity and technology improvements will be less .
Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what happened in the past .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using the surveillance technology to track people .
Therefore , the theatre or the company is lying .
Now , about the tickets , the were different prices but there were not discounts , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .
On the other hand , when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people , it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions .
There were everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday .
A couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend who is into music and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .
Moreover , the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters .
However , it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society is progressing well and people are living with better conditions .
Secondly , the show started one hour fifteen in the past .
The only one term for me to visit you is July .
I think all of us home is something which is very important .
Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding it are rising .
I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happens .
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to the problems beyond my control .
This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet .
Moreover , I could not go to the theatre restaurant because , by the time the show had finished , it had already closed .
I love swimming , but I am not good at swimming .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would be not sufficient medical resources for usage .
This is a scene seen in the Resort World Sentosa .
When not using it , just switch off the card , then it will be just a useless paper .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam

Population aging is a global phenomenon that arises in both developed and developing countries .
When technology is not so well developed , it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information .
Is there a possibility to stay in a log cabin .
In the past , when people injured or fall into sickness , there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered , therefore people can easily die by infected with a small disease .
Without all this technology we may need to live in the same condition like centuries ago , with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and human nations have no solution .
A traditional way to earn money , in the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to families in your town or village .
In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland , the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80 .
And the main reason why our family is so friendly , it 's because we do n't have many rules .
However , this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons .
For example , people go somewhere , no matter taking buses , MRT or driving , they are under the CCTVs .
Avoiding corruption and separating power is more important than forbidden surveillance technology .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Not long from now SARS , as blurry as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Meanwhile , these activities are developed .
THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPBER .
The star , the actor Danny Brook , there was n't a musical show , but there was another actor , with my great disappointment .
I can only travel in July because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the month he can give me , so I hope it is n't a problem for you .
People need a safe environment to live in , and also needs a private environment to stay independent .
Tennis is also my favorite hobby and I play twice every week with my friends .
There is an experience in life time .
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
The rising of life expectancies shows the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so many centuries therefore it is an achievement .
Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned , the regulations of using that are expected .
Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business .
One day I decided to tell my best friend , Pat , who I realio-on her .
They pull up the age to retire .
A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world .
I could n't really do much , so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs .
I ran back home to help .
On the other hand , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us .
The fast development of medicine and technological products makes people 's lives much healthier compared to the past .
ANSWERING FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or stories written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old .
You have to read it yourself .
This from also can be used as a tracking device where the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
He had not liked this habit and had thought it was the worst of him until he solved a big crime .
The biggest difference between human and animals or any other objects is that we have self-esteem or we need the basic respect from our peer .
I have chosen activities surfing and photography .
Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information , for example traveling .
There are various advantages of using surveillance technology .
I look forward to hearing from you .
It can provide a safe , convenient , reliable environment .
I was promised that after the show I could go to a theatre restaurant but due to started late we also finished late therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were deffinately closed .
The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some ideas like to prevent using too many natural resources .
The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret .
All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies , and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement .
The economy of the country is boosted up and further leads to the new development and rise up our living standard .
It is useful to the government and the people in the law sector .
However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .
Everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentists use modernized electrical items instead of just a plier , even homes are effected .
And swimming is very good for your health .
Paya Chuaswee ( Miss )
Every technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons .
However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .
Dear Mr. Robertson
I 'm writing to you to relate my experience in helping at a pop concert last month .
Yes ! ! !
In my opinion , the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement .
Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes too much work .
The first challenge is the decreasing number of new born .
So Surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
This fact becomes very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information releasing without knowing also brings the public 's concern .
I was in her room and helping her .
Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs .
And all of it is free , according to your programme we have the science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping .
Some may use it to peek or record something illegal .
That is to say , we can use it in some specific and special areas such as public security and politics .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization can not match our material aspect , old people will have a tough twilight years .
The challenge will increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the aging population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
With the aging population , many countries are facing the same challenge as building safety houses , facilities to cater to the old aged .
What do you want more ?
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : What kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list .
There is also a Hercule Poirot , a famous detective and he finally solves the mystery .
Yours faithfully,
I really recommend this book to you , it is fabulous .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam
Yours sincerely,
An example will be in Korea .
In conclusion , RFID benefited people more than brought harmful side effects to human body by considering for human safety .
Maria was speechless , it was the first time that she did n't know what to do , so she decided to stop talking to Pat .
Everything was set ... the day and an hour came .
But I could n't shut my mouth , I continued : <unk> <unk> You ca n't believe it Pat , she wears trousers like men and green flowery blouses '' Of course , my friend and I were laughing during half an hour .
I 'm fine .
Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she could keep this kind of secret .
In addition , I think you have to take also plans from the school 's Nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can recognise that the teachers are very good .
Even our applications in our iPhones or other smartphones , our I-pad can easily reveal our locations .
Sincerely ,
Thanks very much .
She was a very pretty and kind girl , but she had this bad habit .
That means when the child grows up , they need to take care of both parents .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they can even need not to bring any money along with them .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I also thank you for the excellent idea of one ticket for all events , which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in .
I will only be able to set off in July and I will also give my thesis to my teacher in August .
In the not-very far 1914 , parents sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
Fashion of the Future .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask you about .
This is not imaginable during less developed times .
I would like to travel in July for two reason one 's is because I totally will finish my exam on that date and the other in the first two weeks I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and will be there the delegation from my country .
For example , there is always news on newspapers , reports that some elderly get lost at certain places and their families are looking for him or her .
Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk .
In my opinion , I think we should study balance it well , one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the human life , one side , we should consider using asking some sick old men whether if they want to take euthanasia .
Moreover , as shown in many Hollywood movies , Google mail is also accessible for the FBI .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and houndreds of Coblights on the right place .
Dear Sir or Madam , Dear Sir and Madam
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
Secondly , I am interested in discovering something that I have never done before , so I would like to do sailing .
I have questions to .
We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods , it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Also , you wrote about discounts , but it 's not true !
Without surveillance technology , suspicious people might actually commit murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police can not arrive in time to help out .
13th June 2000
Cooking became faster with the help of the microwave .
Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and every day comforts , in these two weeks .
Subject : About daily life at our school
From these points , we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .
Jazz , rock and classical concerts are amazing , but I think that some concert halls are too small , so not everybody can come .
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT 'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SEAT AT HOME , CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER REALISATION .
IN ADITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET .
Dear Kim ,
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in the field .
You should have said that they were very few .
On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent them from losing it .
