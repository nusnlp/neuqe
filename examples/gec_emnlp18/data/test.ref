Sorry I have n't written to you for such a long time , but I 've got a good excuse !
I am looking forward to our meeting .
There has been a change in the relationships between people .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
And they will use most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc .
When the government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens , it can gradually exert control over them .
This technology could also be seen as invading human privacy .
The initial function is good indeed : to track the movements of prisoners to protect public safety and interest if they are out of prison .
The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is compatible as well with our programme because by 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .
However , during the process of developing our life , we decided to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down .
Thanks to modern technology , I enjoy chatting with my friends in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day .
According to your advertisement , it is LONDON 'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW , but I was deeply disappointed with it .
I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager .
This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution .
At work , supervisors usually ask the so-called " old staff ' to lead the newbies .
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take any money with me .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
That is to say , they are never happy with what they get or see .
Dear Madam :
Hope to hear from you later .
Technical and Warm Home People 's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology .
When all the money had gone from a bank , nobody was there except Pat .
Maybe , it is because modern society has become more and more competitive ; parents are paying much attention and importance to their careers .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
The girl who sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mentioned about how the discounts availability was written in the advertisement .
Economists can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trends of the local area as well as for the whole country .
This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product loss because of the tracking .
Yours sincerely ,
Danny Brook is one of my favourite actors and there appeared a different one .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show , and we would like to ask you if it is possible to make some changes to the programme .
I can not believe that I won the first prize ( it 's great ! )
We thought , as usually we do in London theatres , we could get discounts , and it 's written on your advertisement .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Yours faithfully
In most countries healthcare is provided free from government .
Examples of how advanced healthcare in the city has raised life expectancy are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
Lo Son Lin .
Everyone told us it was breathtaking .
Maybe for women , but not for me .
Then if his house gets burgled , perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back .
Last but not least , I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately .
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers , journalists and photographers , famous people will just have to get used to this living `` under a microscope '' .
I think in the future home might be just the place to go to sleep .
But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he told us that the operation was a very simple one .
Could you give me half of my money back ?
Our question now is : could we go to this show ?
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON LIFESTYLE , PERSONALITY AND NEEDS .
Anyway it was so interesting a time that I did n't even feel tired after that .
It will be on the 14th and we all want to go .
We pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that are n't money , success , power .
Take care ,
I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie .
It was great to hear from you , have n't seen you since last summer holiday , hope everything is fine at your place .
In conclusion , rising life expectancy is a challenge as it results in more potential problems for future sustainable economic development .
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky .
To finish my `` marvellous '' ev '' evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
It is believed that our lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc .
Despite the challenges of an aging population , it can be an advantage as less people are in competition to bid for one job position .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
In my opinion , modern technology makes our life easier .
What should be a concern is how it can be applied in the right area in a right way .
Finally , I was wondering if any special clothes are required and how much pocket money I need for this trip ?
The trip that you have planned for us students is a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city .
It was my favourite musical .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people have switched from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
He did not perform that evening .
To make matters worse , the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisement was closed .
I explained to him where the street was that he was looking for and we carried on with the conversation for a while .
love
First of all , people might think more about the function of clothes than the design .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people 's lives .
Overall , rising life expectancy can be considered as an advantage and disadvantage to the country .
I look forward to hearing from you .
How has modern technology changed our daily lives ?
How much money do you recommend me to bring with me ?
We hope changing the excursion programme a little will not cause any problems .
Before people find another planet to live on , the earth is the only habitat for us , and has limited capacity to support life . It limits the quantity of people that can live here .
It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from youth .
No evidence is recorded .
13th June , 2000
There are millions of doctors all over the world , but there are billions of patients as well .
Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find the way to a place that someone has never been before .
I have the following questions :
We do n't even spend time with our families .
In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staff that evening ! !
I felt regret but it was too late . It was n't a secret anymore now .
For example , at the time of our visit there is going to be `` The London Fashion and Leisure Show '' .
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65 .
Their lives had become meaningless and a lot of them chose suicide to avoid giving trouble to others .
The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public .
If you have to run from one shop to another , always looking at your watch , going shopping is a terrible activity .
First of all , I am a student and would like to travel in July .
You wanted to cheat me , so I will be very pleased if you could give my money back .
Specially at weekends .
The area for parking , space for children to play or bus station near the mall are not really adequate .
I did n't have the 'perfect evening out ' you 'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible .
Yours sincerely ,
However , the chip implant can be retrieved easily and reimplanted onto other people and so on the tag .
It is the outcome of advanced medical technology , changing lifestyles and higher living standards .
As long as the regulations for using are obeyed , surveillance technology can serve as a good tool .
And once this happens , privacy does not exist any more and people 's lives are under great threat .
My wife Catrin is a local champion in swimming races .
But shopping is not always enjoyable .
About camp activities , I would prefer to do basketball and photography .
We are all very friendly in our class and we help each other when we have a problem .
Introduction
If somebody is a film star this means that he has got a different kind of life , a more comfortable , more interesting life but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .
First of all , now I can phone my friends and parents from every place , I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the Internet .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
He was so amazed and asked her to repeat .
To know where a certain item 's location is one of the ways to improve efficiency .
People 's rising lifespan means that the time of the cycle of generation rises .
One can also easily see a deeply loved one through the Internet from miles away .
To : Mr Ted
When a husband is saying a sweet sentence to his wife , neither of them wants it to be heard by the people behind the monitors .
Some rules are really simple : we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during classes .
And , I forget to say something about the actors , I did n't enjoy them .
Manela B .
This is because I intend to take an examination in September .
A strange thing happened to me , when I got back to that man .
At golf , we are both total beginners .
I look forward to your letter .
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the cuisine . It will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
According to the advertisement you published , there should have been some important differences to the production I saw .
For example , they may wait in a public area and wait for parents who do not pay attention to their child , so that this kind of agency may bring the child to a mountain area and sell him or her for a good price .
In contrast to the advertisement everything was disappointing .
The development of technology is making our life easier and more comfortable .
Wawsaw , 12th December 2000
In history , there were times when governments , such as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union , wanted to secure their governance so badly that the police sniffed around people like dogs their governance the Soviet .
I AM WRITING WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING VERY SOON .
Awful !
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price .
Also , I would like to join the basketball team . I used to play basketball when I was in high school , and our high school basketball team has won many competitions during the last ten years in our city .
By investigating the record of the surveillance technology , they can easily figure out where their kids are now and know roughly what they are doing .
Their opinions are founded on basic human rights .
As soon as the arrangements for the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend .
I have a friend , his name is Peter , he is my best friend .
If they knew that this was the favored route of the people , the government would have had sufficient information to build a walking path that truly benefits the people .
Another aspect could be that if the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves , they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves .
In reference to the date of travel , I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at University and I only have July to take my holidays .
Please excuse me , but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made , which disappointed me very much .
In conclusion , although the global aging issue has become more serious for human development , if we can balance and understand why we live .
Is it very hot ?
Before I came to England , I swam every weekend in my country , even in winter , so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp .
Advanced healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging an individual 's existence on earth .
Both computers and the Internet influence people 's lives .
Without life , we have nothing .
Also , this show is free ( another positive point ) .
I am sure you can understand my disappointment .
Yours sincerely
It was such a great experience !
Trends of highly emotional and easily manipulated humans can be tracked , analyzed , archived and chronicled .
I 'm writing to you as regards the letter you 've sent me about the competition I 've won .
Finally , I would be grateful if you could answer me soon .
What a surprise it was to get a letter from you after all this time .
There are a series of diseases that hinder longevity .
Secondly the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing .
Then , I had read that there would be discounts available , but that was n't true !
Yours sincerely K .
I am very keen on photography .
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something appropriate no matter how much money it costs .
For example , UPS can track the progress of each delivery .
It really happened in China .
Yours sincerely
Finally , the sentence that was written on the advertisement was absolutely not true .
According to the news , the police force mobilized thousands of cops all over the country , each of them prepared to be on duty and patrol in an allocated place and after few months , none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrest him .
We will be learning at home using computers and discs .
Eliza Vasquez .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at .
The surveillance technology worsens the problem by violating people 's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
I have been great , especially last weekend at the Backstreet Boys concert .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
For developed countries , the challenge they face are mainly that the overcrowded modern cities usually have a public transportation problems and also unevenly distributed wealth which results in some of the population being unable to benefit from the development of human society in terms of technology which improves the quality of life .
First of all , we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting programme .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling that people felt in the past .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
!
but why ?
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , emerging technologies always contribute to better living conditions for human beings .
In that case , if they get lost or lose contact , they will be considered as lost and , they may not survive .
Reality kills people in mind .
After finding and analyzing the black box of the plane after the incident , police investigators found the reasons that caused this serious incident .
We were only waiting for Agatha , who was expected at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend .
There is a truth that we can not deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machines are more honest than people .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there were on holiday .
On the other hand , the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murderers and they might not commit more murders since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police .
It will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday the 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , the workers are considered to become fewer and each worker needs to pay more for the welfare of the old people .
However , this should not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates with a nation 's provision of quality healthcare benefits and support for senior citizens .
The average life span rose from 45 years old in the 1920s to over 65 years old in the 2010s .
Moreover , we can try to reduce the bad effects caused by the new technology .
He just moved his nose !
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Anyway the disco was great , music also .
I hope you will consider this matter .
I would like to travel in July .
However , this term has been a far cry from the others .
Hello !
One day Peter killed a boy .
In my opinion , shopping gives me a lot of satisfaction especially when I am depressed . Nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp .
In general , surveillance technology benefits society and should be used with the consideration of individuals ' lives .
Besides illness , the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality .
When the concert started , I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and thirsty .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
In transportation , almost all of the people have cards for daily transport .
In addition , the younger generation is to start their own family in their own place rather than staying together with family .
In such a situation , society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way .
One day , when Maria was sitting in her bedroom , someone knocked on the door . It was Manuel . He was worried about her .
There has been a report estimating that by the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan will be able to work .
So we can go shopping instead .
It is useful as it reduces the chances of occurring .
It has been quite a long time since someone has raised the importance of the right of privacy .
We can get information more quickly .
I personally stand together with the people who reject the proposal .
It is a very hard thing to predict .
People did not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed .
RFID is also useful in police activities .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
Moreover , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
It was a very exciting moment and a very nice competition .
In the letter you said that the accommodation provided can be either a tent or a log cabin .
I am let down by your behaviour .
This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist law enforcers , such as the police , to collect evidence of crimes after they occur .
An ageing population leads to a working force composed with a larger percentage of elderly who have lower productivity and are thus unable to meet the expectancy .
For me this adventure was one of the best .
Thank you for everything
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Moreover , you could face an aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
This phenomenon increases the demand of property and subsequently affects both price and size together .
But I have finally got around to writing and you 'll see that it 's definitely been worth waiting for as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
What a surprise !
Finally let me know what kind of clothes will be the most suitable at camp .
However , disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying .
Anni .
Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis .
With the development of technology , we have more advanced methods to track people in today 's society .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
If cancers are discovered too late , one is doomed to death at a later stage .
Would you give me some information about me clothes to wear there ?
But at the end of the day it will always be the place to go !
I 'm going to help them again .
I really wished to have a friend with whom I could share everything that is going on in our lives .
On the other hand , people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as the newer I-Pad model .
I was thinking 'what should I do ? '
I hope that you can provide a better service next time , and this time you need to give back the money we paid .
Life is more enjoyable for young adults .
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important , or more or less enjoyable depending on what , why , where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing .
The ones I 'm most keen on are tennis , at which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax and forget about problems .
The main actor was an unknown actor .
Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects , I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it .
After 3 weeks , Maria got ill so she was not able to go to school .
Apologise me for disturb .
Write to you next time .
To finish this letter , I would like to give you a good idea for next year .
Thus , the rising expectancies actually reflects the increasing stability and comfort of people 's life and indirectly reflects the ability of the govenment to provide people with their current comforts , economic status , convenience and others .
Because there was a man who had had a serious car accident and I was walking past him .
Fewer famines , better sanitation and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century 's greatest achievement as a global society .
The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well .
Rising life expectancy can be a challenge .
I am writing in reply to your letter . I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
The ability to eliminate illness is considered as an achievement as this proves that the ability of the human race to research and develop the medical abilities to cure and eliminate the illnesses that able to take the life of a human at a earlier age .
One of the basic rights of humans is the right for privacy .
If a company really uses this technology to track their employees , employees will dislike it and claim that their human right to privacy has been violated .
Thanks a lot for your letter .
But everyone always saw from his face he had a secret .
At the same time , people must be able to protect their privacy without sharing their location with strangers .
However , there was a different , unknown actor in that .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people 's life more convenient .
They can live a happy life , but actually to the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Where could they be ?
Mischievous cases could actually cause chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it with ill intentions .
The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone .
Dear Kim
When Thomas Adison invented electric light , it was the greatest invention for people of that century .
On the other hand if you can walk around without any time problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable .
My job was to leave some leaflets in shops , restaurants and on the streets .
I 've never been camping before , I guess I 'm not an outdoor girl , but I 'd like to give it a try , so I 'd rather tents than cabins .
It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie , and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others ' observation , just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world , broadcast to billions of people .
Now , many cell phones are equipped with GPS which means that owners can find the device 's location if it is lost .
Today , however , people do not need to spend much time on making food , washing up , or even on turning the light on and off .
This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country .
4 .
Yours faithfully ,
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness .
I hope in your answer and in your explanation about this .
Now , I will answer your questions .
Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Please let me know if you need more information .
What did you feel ?
In countries like Singapore , manpower is the only natural resource available which Singapore can invest in as she does not have enough land to build farms and factories .
It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried .
How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
Some of the public want to use this technology to implant RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
As for the future , who knows ?
Every word people say can be heard by the government and because of that , the government knows well about everyone 's mind and wants to wash everyone 's mind and control normal people totally .
Camp California in the U.S.A .
Because the fashion show lasts a whole day .
People expect more on the ground of the current economy , life stability and desire fulfillment .
If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
Nowadays , the pressure from the head of a company towards the employees has caused people to fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that , people have started to ignore their health condition and rely on treatment and supplements .
Therefore , the challenge is that we need to maintain or improve the state of living is huge .
In , electronic devices , such as computers , are also inevitable to increase the productivity of the corporation .
It does n't matter what kind of career or job you have .
Love ,
Alvaro
First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had such a good time in my life !
However , as the life expectancy of people rises , the population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon .
It started a week before that day .
All in all , the RFID system is used to capture the information of the object and track it .
Only when there is ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
Since not all human beings are going to be a doctor , people rely on the treatment skills of doctors and hence , they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health .
Yours faithfully ,
I also told her to keep it very secret and not tell anyone in the class .
What I really enjoyed was being part of the staff .
I 'm looking forward to hearing what you think about this !
Thus , rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government 's well-planned or managed schemes .
People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .
How much money should I take with me and what sort of clothes are required
She said that I had to be strong and not care about them .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
They are not contradicting each other .
When her best friend , Scala , asked her for an idea to surprise her husband with because she was pregnant , Pat put her foot in it just before Scala 's husband had the surprise .
The achievement is in comparison with history in the past .
Rising life expectancy is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement .
On the other hand ,  rising life expectancy can also be an indication , though not entirely , of a country 's responsibility to their citizens .
There were many events and I think there were a few plays and films .
A few days after I told her about my secret love story , it became top gossip among my classmates .
Faithfully ,
If RFID comes into existence , this kind of case can be totally avoided in no time .
Could you please let me know as soon as you receive my letter ?
This choice does n't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves .
There are some machines which have helped in my development , and others which help me to make my life easier .
He asked me whether the cheeseburger was hot and I answered that it was .
It is well-known statistically that , generally , as a country develops life expectancy increases .
Technology has a huge effect on our spare-time activities as well .
Therefore , you have to be calm because , as you know , things are developing and in the same way you 're changing , too .
Unconnected part of We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this is money .
After the invention of the phone and Internet , there are more ways to use to communicate with people and even track people .
She 's a secretary in an office .
People 's average age has become older compared to the past .
There is lots of illness that was thought incurable in the past that has vanished in the world .
From : Meng
Sometimes you could find a bargain .
I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
First of all , I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July .
It basically serves to locate your iphone 's position at any single time . For instance , if someone left his phone in a certain place , he can check his phone 's location by searching through the Internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friend 's device .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe .
Yours faithfully ,
Moreover when I send e-mail , I do n't need to worry about the time .
I would like to go in July , I do n't mind which two weeks , but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family .
THAT NIGHT , I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER .
Probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you ca n't have it .
Actually , this technology has already been weaved into our life .
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance .
In addition , retirement is a must in some countries .
Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free changing room and waste time putting on some clothes when in the end they are not the right size .
I have just received your letter , and thank you very much for your reply .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficiently which will lead to a lower effective output .
In summary , we should respect all life and also help people to live longer .
Everyone knows the Internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point to examples such as Facebook .
Dear Madam
The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources .
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert .
Famous people are living creatures .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to society can not be neglected anymore .
I would be grateful if you could send me a brochure and a map showing where the camp is .
They may die from hunger , die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never woke again .
I am going to finish my exams in June , and I am planning to go back to China in early August .
We are on the right track .
On one surveillance helps government guard civilians ' property and life . the other the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable because of the 24 hours ' monitoring .
Surveillance technology such as RFID (  radio-frequency identification ) has been made it possible to track people by implanting certain markers on people or products .
On the other hand we have faced some problems , such as social and environmental problems .
I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed .
There are also medical tools that are more of an implant into the human body for basic medical research .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
The place where we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days setting up the stage , the equipment , and the lights .
We had to adjust the laser extremely carefully to get it in the correct position .
To Mr Robertson ,
I think that this programme is well-organised , as you know , because we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .
It is like a key that opens up the gate of the human body defense system and provides a cleared path for other diseases to attack .
Police can put tags on those that have potential to commit crimes .
As the aging population grows , the young and more energetic people are subject to supporting more people of old age .
I TOLD HIM I DID N'T KNOW WHERE I WAS , BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY .
Among these basic rights , the most important one is the right to life .
About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I have got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months .
Then , the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking devices to find the place even if he has never gone there before .
What kind of clothes are needed ?
Although the initial reason for the of implementation of RFID is good for children ; however , children also have human rights and privacy which is threatened by this technology .
We talk about the first possibility .
The people who are on the run from the mafia will be at risk !
And well , Mrs Helen , I would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions .
However , since space and resources on earth are very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
It is wonderful for me to have the opportunity to visit Camp California in the U.S.A .
IN MY OPINION , PEOPLE WILL ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITIES DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
This would result in a loss of manpower in the country .
The government is supposed to serve the people .
I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .
I hope you 'll understand my situation and if you want other people to visit your show , you should return my money .
So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely aggressive .
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING ( ESPECIALLY IN POLAND , WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED ) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HYPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS , MOTORBIKES OR COMPUTERS .
Moreover , life expectancy has also been rising due to the development of the economy .
Although the accommodation is n't so important for me ,
In recents decedes , it is a trend that people are able to live a longer life .
From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves . But we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
I was looking for a special fruit .
Not only the details of location will be provided , but also details that may lead to the children trading agency and help to prevent more of this kind of tragedy from happening to any family .
Anyway , I had a lot of fun working for them .
It may lead to a more efficient decision and provide more sales and revenue for the company .
In answer to your letter ,
It monitors everybody 's movement or activity , and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law , etc .
Apart from the diseases themselves , deficiency in medical system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also combine to make lifespan shorter .
While we are using technology , we should take into consideration the environment .
Thus , there will be too few in the labor force , which will lead to a decreasing rate of development of the country .
It is not only scary but also illegal .
Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to give you the information you have requested .
So I can afford to go on holiday only in July .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and gather demographic data for various uses .
In winter we are to change our shoes .
Furthermore , I think it will be a good idea to take plans from a match of our school team on the football pitch as it is completely new and fully equipped .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground .
If you do n't find anything good enough for you do n't worry , you should always remember : It 's not all about the money !
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , but I trusted him anyway .
Home sweet home .
Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing I dreamed about a lot .
All the achievements humans make influence the lifespan of people .
The elderly will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing to their whole working career .
However ,  rising life expectancy is also a challenge to the entire human race .
I would also like to claim a refund for the evening .
`` Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . ''
There was a saying which says that hunger can turn people back to animals .
It is a challenge when illness can not be easily avoided by any person with a stressful lifestyle any place in the world .
I miss Peter very much , it 's unfair to put him in a prison .
If this piece of information is misused , chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even endanger the life of the consumer .
For example , one might have liked to have I-Phone 5 in the past but he or she would expect it to have more functions or operate at a faster speed after using it a while .
As you state in your letter I have to choose the type of accommodation .
As I told you in my last letter , last month I worked for a pop band , and helped them at a concert in Barcelona .
But , I got through it .
And you can see their clothes also .
Firstly , I would like to give you some details about this show .
Yours sincerely ,
As I am a fan of musicals I went to see this show .
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY TO DO IT .
From the view of my point , I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security .
That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise .
MAY 29 , 1997 .
To sum up , modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot and this is going to continue .
For logistics , if all products have tags , it is much easier to count and record all the products .
So you have to complain about it .
Population ageing has also brought us debate on life expectancy . It is challenging but also an achievement .
Yours Sincerely
Machines , such as the dishwasher , washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work .
The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a chance to go .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
It is convenient for customers to track and confirm where and how their goods are now .
Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory .
The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation , better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the perpetrator .
If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night .
Yours faithfully ,
Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track lost people but is also useful to prevent the trading of children , which happens in many developing countries .
How are you ?
Japanese society is now facing a severe ageing problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
On the other hand , the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction , which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past .
Parents do not need to worry about where their kids will go after the school .
In other words , people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods because modern people need respect not money .
Then , in the programme I could read about a discount available on the tickets , for groups , but I could n't get that .
It was the happiest moment of my life .
With advanced medical technology , not only can many diseases be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
Dear Friend ,
One of the most common examples is babysitting . Taking care of little children is easy and it does n't require special skills : all you need is a lot of patience .
Definitely , there are those who agree with using surveillance technology but also those who object .
And finally the journalists should know how to respect the private lives of everyone and not try to make money by using the reputation of famous people .
On one side , we can not deny that rising life expectancy is a great achievement expectancy .
If the production of food is showing a lower growth rate compared to the population 's growth rate , the country will end up with insufficient food in the future .
Nights in hol .
It is a challenge but also an achievement .
Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops .
Yours sincerely ,
And of course , the time to pay .
I sometimes have trouble with backache when I ca n't sleep on a flat surface .
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know some further information about travel and accommodation .
Every move is being closely surveilled and followed once we step out of our homes .
Last month , I was partly in the concert teams .
Once again , congratulations on the Festival .
A few years ago , there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat , one of terrorists of Osama , who successfully escaped from the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore .
Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer .
Since it is read-only , the card can not protect itself .
This observation means that the more developed the country , the longer the life span its citizens .
With the strong support of technology , the rise in life expectancy can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society .
By the way , I have n't seen Pat for about one year .
Rising life expectancy can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
And finally I would like to ask you some questions .
My duties as a staff member were various . The first day I had to pick the bands up from the airport , and for this I hired a van .
He was trying to speak in Spanish , but his accent was terrible .
Furthermore , some parents hold positive views on surveillance technology and would agree to implant RFID into their children 's body .
Also people have begun to realize the importance of the environment and the need to protect people from harmful air .
I am looking forward to your reply !
We should separate it into two aspects .
We know that as the population of humans continues to grow year by year , we are using more non-recoverable natural resources , such as oil , in everyday life . People . such as 's life and technological improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil .
In conclusion , it is delightful to observe the fact that life expectancy is rising , but one must have the idea in mind that a rising life expectancy is never easy .
I need any extra money ?
In my opinion the majority of people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families , so , for them , shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money .
Recommendations
More challenges also include the environmental challenges that have been seen over the years .
However , this natural resource is not renewable .
For instance , a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore , and is currently keeping track of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system , a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching another 's card .
Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget throughout my whole life
Normally , people will regard an extended life expectancy as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of countries .
To our disappointment , now the technology is not so advanced that it can support all human beings with limited resources .
Fashion in 100 years
The second life expectancy is increased medical technology and resources .
Working long hours , doing plenty of activities , going out , going on holidays .
The next consideration is the activities .
This significantly raised people 's average life expectancy .
In any country , there are crimes everyday and it is obvious to see that not all the culprits have been arrested and punished .
These are some points I want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities .
It is natural that rising life expectancy is regarded as an achievement .
Maybe some people will be naked .
In some kindergartens , RFID is used to tag the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts .
On Thursday , the 3rd of May 2000 , we went to your theatre to see `` Over the rainbow '' .
The reason I am really writing , however , is to give you some details about my trip to California .
There are kidnappings everywhere and not all of the families can afford the ransom that is required by the kidnappers .
I also hope that the festival could be even better next year .
Because of surveillance technology , more and more things being tracked and more and more clues can be used .
And recently , I have been practising tennis as a school activity .
Recently , a newly developing surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification , or RFID for short , has generated heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people .
The very about young people , the decision to offer a reasonably priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .
Write to me as soon as you can .
With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID , spying on the population would be much easier , which will create an even worse situation for citizens .
I am glad .
I was so disappointed about that .
Life expectancy has risen significantly from the past to today all over the whole world .
However , if nothing happens inside his house , then the surveillance becomes useless , and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being monitored .
I 'm writing to you to complain about the musical show that I went to last evening .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Love
For example , the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner .
The number and types of illness also increase relative to the age too .
We had n't so many machines as they have .
It depends on what you need .
Their opinion is based on protecting the children 's safety and parents ' guardian .
There were some stories I never told anyone before , but I shared with her all my secrets .
I must say that the rules are n't the same in the schools of our country .
So , it would be great if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show .
because of this all my opinions about the self-important behaviour of superstars have changed .
And concerning my accommodation ,
Life expectancy can be defined as a desired level of service or better technology to make one 's life more comfortable .
Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles .
It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
We were studying in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well .
To be honest , I wanted to share this feeling with someone else but I needed to keep it very secret .
It was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be .
In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world -- the Internet .
I recently saw this in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London and I must say I had a very disappointing evening !
I think that the most important piece of modern technology these days is the Internet .
Now I am going to give you some further information : I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is the most important year of my life . I am studying for the university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then at the end of June I will have the university entrance exam and after that , in July , I am going to be alright .
Ten or fifteen years ago we had empty shelves in shops in Poland .
Best wishes
Without such surveillance technology , we would have a better future .
Regarding your letter dated the 6th of June I 'm so happy to receive the first prize .
Every school has its own rules .
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California .
Even though we could spend our holiday there but with my mum and I just found that it was fantasy time which I had never .
Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes .
Second , when technology like RFID is widely used , there will be a trend to misuse such technology .
And another question is what are the prices of things like there , which I want to know so that I can make a better budget for my trip .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participation .
For instance , reading , looking for some information or using the computer .
In fact , these rising demands require a stronger workforce who is active and more productive than in the past .
I look forward to your reply ,
It was terrible .
Is there a toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby ?
I regret to have to demand all my money back .
It 's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities .
Yours sincerely
Many diseases which were incurable in the past can be cured now .
Yours sincerely ,
Also tents are not very comfortable .
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL THAT IS TAKING PLACE AT THE CIRCLE THEATRE .
Yours truly
Regarding the accommodation , I would like to have a log cabin rather than a tent because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy .
I 'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000 .
Dear Ms Ryan
It is only two or three years since I started using a computer at home , but now I wonder how I could live without one .
I had to buy my dress , its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs !
During a rescue , every second is valuable !
When the show started the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and the replacement did n't seem to be an actor .
More healthcare is needed for elderly people than for young adults .
The advertisement said there were discounts available , which were not available .
Moreover , how much money do you think we will spend on this trip ?
Moreover , achieving the near impossible to eliminate all illness , such as cancer , would be the greatest achievement for the human race .
I hope you understand .
WOULD YOU PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO CHANGE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PLANNED ?
Without the use of surveillance , the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly , and the loss caused by SARS might be many times more than that in 2003 in Singapore .
Anni Soler
Will you provide me with an instructor when I climb and swim ?
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Marvellous thing !
Other diseases , such as mental disorders and heart trouble , are also top killers , current medicine does have methods to treat patients , but risks still come along .
Because the land is limited , the average land for one person is very small already .
And all the evidence has been collected through hidden surveillance when he thought he was safely expressing his opinion in his house !
Such technology would put people into the same circumstance as the pupils but the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second .
I never thought that I would win the competition .
Most of the time shopping is fun and enjoyable .
It was a summer night and all the citizens , as well as tourists , had the opportunity to attend .
However , this will raise a privacy protection issue .
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated natural regulation .
Respect is essential .
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my trip .
After a certain age , they will have to retire .
This also works and we have seen the effect .
1 .
To sum up I enjoy wasting money whether buying useful things or not .
As we have mentioned above , as human beings , we should enjoy our privacy during our life as long as we do not cause harm to others .
Yours sincerely ,
As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & bought the bread for the evening .
Surveillance technology will help to prevent families from losing their members , especially the elderly and the children who need to be paid more attention to .
According to your brochure , the show would start at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m .
We had fun until 5 o'clock !
Love from ,
People in general have a compulsion to shop , in my opinion .
Second , I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening .
Deceived ?
In the era of Warring States , warriors lost their arms or legs or even all of them .
Well my friend , I have to go , because I have got an appointment with the Dentist .
However , we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show , which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March .
I would like to complain about the show which you presented last Saturday .
Thus , let us discuss the pros and cons now to give you a clearer view of surveillance technology .
We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of dead people annually .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can offer better security .
thanking you in anticipation .
BUT , WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY , I REALISED THAT IT WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND , REALLY , I WAS DISAPPOINTED .
In addition to this , I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I have had and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refund for part of the money I wasted there .
That 's why I could n't have dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
First of all the only suitable time for me to go is July .
I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night .
If the technology can be made to adjust to human being 's feelings , it would be more welcomed by those concerned about privacy .
It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel .
Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks .
But in what way ?
While it is applaudable that people have achieved great success in prolonging their lives , there are social challenges posed by rising life expectancy .
When these scholars are on field journeys , they also have to relate their observations with their route information ; this is when RFID is of great significance .
I 'm a tourist and I had a week 's holiday in London some time ago .
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play `` over the inbow '' , wh '' which showing the at Circle Theatre .
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR .
An example is the Nazi secret police that Hitler used to dispose ( of bodies literally ) and stamp out any of Hilter 's opposition using fear ( and maybe guns , knives and poison ) .
In other words , I can also receive their reply quickly .
I learnt from your letter that I 've won the first prize .
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June , so I can only travel in July .
First , I will discuss the challenges of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall .
How are you ?
I have recently bought a new camera .
I have to use a computer every day .
It 's terrible !
It was a surprise to learn that I won the first prize .
Firstly , knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them in knowing what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change routes to avoid potential danger .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one 's constitution weakens as one ages .
I 'm Francesco Schein , I 'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' .
I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS . THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS .
Concerning the available activities , firstly , I would choose climbing because I have done it for many years .
It is really wonderful .
I have been playing basketball in a team in my town for ten years .
In reality , people are afraid of being tracking everywhere , not because of intentions to commit crimes , but the spirit of freedom and privacy that is in everyone 's heart .
More importantly , they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through the Internet , to make more interested people get involved and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful .
This would result in a decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem , especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum .
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail , or normal mail .
My name is Marie Bouchard , I come from Switzerland .
Without a doubt , rising life expectancy is definitely a success in human history as it shows the achievements of the medical field in finding out ways and medicines to treat diseases that were thought to be incurable in the past and providing people with vaccines to prevent diseases .
What do I have to pay myself ?
And he spends 1000 dollars to install a surveillance system in his house .
It helps me with preparing my homework .
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to get a present for someone in my family .
Also , during my stay at Camp , there are two activities I can choose . For one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most . I and my friend used to win the first place in the school-wide match when we were at school .
We will be able to speed up the running of computer games , for example ...
Cars and trucks have diminished the transit time of long distance shipment .
More elderly people will bring a very extra burden to society and government .
There are two possibilities .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON .
This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries , and hence affects the productivity of the world .
The show lasts nine hours , from 10.00-19.00 , the whole day !
She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her .
Of course , yes !
When I get to the camp , I 'd like to swim and climb .
For all these reasons , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
This book helps us to improve our logic , mind , and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie , to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much .
It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it .
Can you send me a letter back writing what happened to you recently ?
The tags can be used on those who need to be taken care of or beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerned about his whereabouts when the parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lose her .
Here is where the good part starts , I was doing the curtains ( opening and closing ) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him . My heart started beating very hard .
If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want .
So could you give us permission to go ?
For society , there is a more efficient transportation system .
I WAS REALLY SCARED .
The improvement in technology also eases people 's lives by replacing all the manual labour with easy and simple machine work .
At that time I used the computer only to play video games .
I hope you understand your mistakes and I 'm asking you for our money back .
Nowadays , things have changed .
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even to just a little privacy .
Only if it is being used in a wise and sensible approach and be adjusted and refined very profoundly , can it bring us the maximum benefit .
I worked eight hours every day , but in every fast-food restaurant you can work part-time , four , three , six hours every day .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful with appropriate handling and usage .
Now you 're probably asking yourself what does that mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
You offer a great variety of activities .
I thank you for organizing it , and hope to see more next year .
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ WHO WAS STARRING .
We have had a quite pleasant time except for that evening .
I have always dreamt about holidays 'in Camp California '
I thought that it could only be seen by 3 people , but that was a mistake ... Pat saw it !
Finally , we worked the whole night before the concert .
Another thing I want to complain about is that you advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .
According to your advertisement , the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
As the pace of life becomes faster and faster , the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field .
The rising life expectancy is considered a challenge as a smaller workforce results as the population ages ; high burden for governments to support financially too many ageing people .
My suggestion for next year 's festival is simple - please make it a few days longer !
That was why she decided to change her behaviour .
Machines have replaced coolies and heavy labor .
I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going shopping , so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
In conclusion , surveillance technology has been used in a much broader area .
Without sending back any images or sound record , RFID is more user-friendly and helps preserve the user 's privacy as much as possible .
For men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money buying clothes , cosmetics , accessories , jewellery etc .
The development of technology brings people joy and makes things easier and this may be one of the achievements .
I thought that I had found a good friend in my life .
Maria was nervous , but , for the first time , she could talk to him as she never had before , and at the end of the day , she was the happiest person in the world . She had her first kiss and she had Pat 's friendship back ; after all , everything happened because of her .
I 'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter , so referring to the question of when I would like to travel , I would like to go anytime during July , because I have to be back home in August , because I need to apply and get everything sorted out , to go to college next September .
She was given a chance : if she was able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would start trusting her .
Rising average life expectancy can surely cause some problems .
She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared .
This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you .
Two days later , in the morning , a policeman came to see Peter ...
I have never had any experience of staying in a tent , so I would like to give it a go .
The latest fashions will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear .
Finally , I would like to have a refund for my ticket because it was a horrible evening .
They are imported from another Western European country .
The technology is based on the chip implant or tag .
Somebody could give you not enough change .
Although the increase in population age shows that people have advanced knowledge and technologies , it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement .
I can send them anytime I like .
I 'm also fond of tennis , I 've just started my lessons and would like to continue playing during the summer .
I would be grateful if you could do that .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
However , as technology has developed , it has increased people 's mobility and productivity as well as life expectancy .
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time making intimate friendships with people around me .
In the future , every child might have a laptop .
However , there are many other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London .
and , of course , I am very happy .
The car and the man were not there anymore .
Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
Nevertheless , humans still need an improvement .
I never accused her of lying , and if you ask me why , I really do n't know .

DEAR MS. RYAN ,
Dear Helen Ryan
Well , that was the beginning of my tragedy .
I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .
For example , thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone 's location .
Take Singapore for example , surveillance is installed everywhere from highly secured places such as Government buildings to working places , from condominiums to housing development board blocks , and even school canteens and toilets !
I felt very angry with Pat and I should n't have told her about my boyfriend .
And how much will I spend there ?
We can find information about the weather and sports on our TV-text .
Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 ; it 's a theatre , not a concert hall ! ! !
However , the idea of using RFID to track people violates our right for privacy .
Dear Clark ,
See you soon
For the rest of their life , they had to rely on their family and financial support from others .
!
Yours faithfully
Please answer my letter as soon as possible .
Do you have any idea what the weather is going to be like ?
Dear Miss Ryan ,
Firstly , I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off at the beginning of the month .
And nobody told me why !
The population is large while resources are limited , many problems will incur such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
How would you feel ?
We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old .
It is unavoidable that some socialists will argue that surveillance technology violates human rights ; however , for the sake of the whole society , surveillance technology should still be used .
I was wondering .
I paint in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes , people , animals .
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that .
In modern society , public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon .
It was boring for everybody .
The fact is that the
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT .
No , in the future , the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old , outdated and changed .
The increasing population of a country gives the government more difficulties in registering the members of each individual family and hence other factors exist as an obstacle to the country 's development .
We had many common interests in music , art and books .
Third , to use surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authorities .
In addition , it is also a challenge for the government , families and parents to educate their children about filial morality .
This was her only fault .
The town became peaceful again .
I hope you are keeping in great shape , like you were the last time I saw you . How is your family ? I hope everyone is OK .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
The rising of life expectancy is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will violate individuals ' privacy .
They signed my diary and had their photo taken with me .
In my view , the Internet can be used in education , because it gives an opportunity to have remote communication between pupils and teachers .
The fashion in nowaday clothing just keeps on changing .
Yours faithfully ,
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent .
Thirdly , compared to young people , the security of the elderly is more necessary .
The worst thing is that I could n't see my favourite actor .
In medicine , people have done a lot of research in life science .
Finally , I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California ?
Other than that , the safety issue can be extended to personal safety .
I would like to have my money back .
Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in places like airports and checkpoints .
In fact , there was nothing very important I did , because we were not the right people to do it .
TO SUM UP , I DID NOT HAVE A PERFECT EVENING .
I am very happy about winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go , but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track people through human implants or tags on products .
When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer .
Goods are dead , but humans are alive .
Yours faithfully
Also tracking people is very dangerous if it is controlled by bad men for a not good purpose .
Dear Jane Clark ,
this prize .
He complained about that a lot .
The usual distance of data exchange can be several meters .
They breathe , eat , feel and aside from the fact that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .
In such a situation , individuals will lose their basic privacy .
Therefore , for ordinary people , there is no need for them to use this technology .
Do I need any formal ones ?
The first time I read this saying I was confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it was hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or sadness for your younger relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since the old person will not suffer any longer .
WE HAVE SEEN THE ACTIVITIES PROGRAMME ALREADY AND WE THINK IT IS EXCITING , ESPECIALLY THE VISIT TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
I was wondering if I need to bring some extra money and thick clothes with me in case there is an emergency .
As society develops , people gradually find that population ageing has brought us many problems .
With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population , increasing numbers of nurses and doctors will have to be available .
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf .
To make him or her more competitive so that the elderly person is not beaten by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
War kills a lot of people , which is not doubted .
It is really a great achievement in the enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types in their daily lives .
The technology is necessary because it can provide evidence in crime investigation and social issues and decrease illegal actions effectively .
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
I wonder if it is all right to come at that time .
The musical should have begun at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 ; this is unacceptable !
Another successful .
Thus , food can play an important role in a healthy population .
Yours sincerely
For example , politicians have chosen their careers ; they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation , and they will not be considered trustworthy .
Yours sincerely ,
Lots of love
The world is always fair to us .
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions , make-up , and hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends .
One day she invited me to her flat .
There is no absolutely perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Many pupils in China have been complaining about their phones , because through their phones , their lives are all transparent to their parents .
Even people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chances to survive and have a longer time to live .
This happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV on several streets in order to better supervise its people and keep order .
For these older people , society needs manpower and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them .
Secondly , it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents .
I would choose Basketball and Tennis .
I always watch the NBA matches on T.V .
In an aged population , low spending affects the economic growth .
With the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Does this sound reasonable to you ?
I hope you 're well and enjoyed the CD and do n't forget to write back all about your news from during your summer holiday job .
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about .
Thanks to his habit , he is still alive and all the money was returned to the bank .
I hope that it will be a good holiday for her , her family and friends .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
Yours sincerely
Supermarkets are also using this technology to tag their products , which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent stealing .
I had to go home without eating dinner , though I was really hungry .
Population ageing is a challenge for economic development .
It also indicates that the economy has dramatically grown .
Then , the show began 45 minutes late , so we had to wait a very long time .
There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
I was so annoyed !
Whenever he has a secret , his nose moves quickly .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to sit examinations for the First Certificate in English .
Leon Hofmann
Another option is to wash your neighbour 's car .
However , it can be considered an advantage as there is little competition in the workforce .
It seems to me that it will be an extremely good advertisement for our school if you take plans from the chemistry lesson in the laboratory , because our laboratory is new , recognised as one of the best in the area as it has a huge amount of equipment and really some very good teachers , and also many experiments are taking place in this laboratory
First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .
I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on it .
Sorry I have n't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job .
And do you think I need to exchange money before I go there ?
An increasing population also leads to problem in food supply .
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but in the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually .
Two weeks ago , I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend .
Regarding accommodation , I think tents would be great .
Yours faithfully
I was struggling because I knew if I did n't help him , he would die in a short time .
We can , however , go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
Peter and Sue asked Francis for some help with their exam subjects and Francis , all week , was too busy to help them .
I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible experience .
Yours faithfully ,
As I have mentioned above , the increase in life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge .
I worked in a team of seven people .
Dear Ms Ryan
I was wondering if there is a coach who could give me a lesson at the Camp .
We reveal our locations , for our friends to catch up with us ; however , we can never know who is watching us out there secretly .
To conclude , rising life expectancy must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
We might still like that old carpet and couch .
The arts students want to learn another foreign language .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveil their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at their friends ' home , and this may help parents regulate their children 's behavior .
Eventually , the company tracking system has no meaning at all . Therefore , tracking systems are very terrible way to control people .
If it is needed , the records could be opened for official use .
With the Internet you can do whatever you want without going out ( shopping , speaking with a friend , working , putting your money aside ... . )
Finally , when the show finished , and I have to say , a bit late , I went to the theatre 's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone .
Yours sincerely
If this technology is abandoned , it may influence more bad people to commit murder or steal things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man 's life .
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government
Is the camp close to a town or city ?
All the best ,
Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .
I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me .
I decided to go to see this show because of its stars , but on the day I saw it , a different actor performed .
For instance , when people get old , they begin to lose their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way home or another place .
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful .
The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys .
A longer working period means old people who are more skilled do not need to retire and inexperienced workers will not need to take over .
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in health care .
If we want to leave a good world to the next generations , we should behave more respectfully towards nature .
My best sports disciplines are swimming and basketball .
Also , the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology and a higher level of civilization of our life .
is the implanted chip definitely safe and feasible ?
In case , they have some accident like heart attack , the track of them will show there is something wrong .
We live in a very busy world !
The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancy higher .
For example , I was born knowing that man has walked on the moon .
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to come to the festival , but it would be nice if next year we could meet some other personalities .
Moreover , students are allowed to attend for free .
First , medical costs will rise greatly .
To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep the privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserves to have a private life .
They become lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button .
It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out .
On the other hand the facilities for access to the shopping center are not good .
Thank you for your attention .
According to the article , " Lawful Interception " , in the US , every telecommunication company has a contract with the FBI , requiring them to keep phone call records easily searchable and accessible to the FBI .
I need to dress up neatly in case one day someone who checks the CCTV will find a girl in weird clothing .
With a doubled life time , humans can have a chance to explore the real meaning of life .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
On the other side , the technology could also be used by the lawbreakers to commit crimes .
Although we have not been implanted with chips we are recorded by CCTV .
I wanted to sleep and it was very annoying .
Finally , I would be grateful to you if you would tell me about clothes and money .
That is to say , there are more and more doubts raised by the public about surveillance technology .
I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and internet technologies .
Maybe , in a few years ' time we 'll have a bigger TV , a more suitable radio but , in my opinion , I think these facts will not change our way of life .
People may say that surveillance technology will be abused intentionally by authorized people .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
It was used to track the path of animals and help in scientific research .
Is it necessary to bring any money ?
This is because people wo n't give up the great taste of food . Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two .
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing , for example bread .
I 'm not so good as her , but I go once every week to her training session .
The bank robbers told him if Pat told the fact somebody they would kill him .
You could also buy something which later turns out to be broken .
Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in a few minutes and you can soon regret buying all those clothes which you do n't really need .
ON THE ONE HAND , THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES .
If you do that , there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them .
And many people are in a hurry , so do n't be surprised if other people do not have the tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping trolleys .
She just remembered it ought to be a secret , and she became really embarrassed .
Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations . It requires at least three conditions to happen : an advanced health care system , reduced hazards from the environment and ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
And we loved each other very much .
If a developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which includes reducing hazards in the environment .
Can you compare it ... ?
However , the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag , which could reveal sensitive information like the consumer 's home address or work address to someone who is not authorized to get the information .
However , an aging population is taxing on a country .
So , I think I 'll do sailing and tennis .
Yu Phu Tung .
It can help to regulate people 's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and gather demographic data .
Furthermore some concert halls were definitely too small or in other words too many people attended those concerts .
They are expecting better medication , healthier food , and a cleaner environment and so on and so forth .
Thank you very much for your recent letter .
I also chose painting because I have never done it before . I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a relaxing activity .
When the holidays begin everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do , but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem for most of us .
I 'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday .
I do n't forget him .
For example , the old people , if they are alone at home , one day , they want to go out for a walk .
It 's very important but sometimes it is a bad thing because the children can see it too .
First the actor was changed and his replacement 's performance was very poor and disappointing .
On the other hand you tell me I have the chance to choose two activities while I am at the camp .
Still the possible disadvantages of these surveillance technologies is too present in my paranoid mind and they clearly outweigh the benefits , in my opinion .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Although life expectancy may increase significantly , the population 's overall productivity may not increase linearly .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I would also like you to specify if the food is included in the prize .
I have known her for five years .
Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you have provided .
For developing countries , they may encounter more shortage of food resources and the problem of how to develop a better medical system to serve the entire nation They also face the problem of how to distribute wealth evenly to benefit the entire population . Moreover , they need to consider carefully how to build the education system so that the next generation will be able to carry on to improve the whole country .
IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT .
By law , citizens have the right to keep their private details unknown to public ; however , their privacy would be violated if such surveillance technology is applied widely .
I use technology every minute but I did not realise .
At the same time , more people are needed to take care of the old ones , which gives the younger generation extra work .
This is more than convenient for the authority to better control of society down to every individual .
She did n't tell me but when I came to the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well .
Of course , more money will be spent .
Consequently , the government is very likely to turn into a totalitarian authority , which will be the worst situation and a tragedy for every single citizen .
These days we can use a computer , television and some sophisticated equipment ,
This form of tracking also not harmful to any person because much of this information all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race .
Our lives are changing .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
RFID can be one of the simple ways to help discourage criminal or terorist acts .
Dear Kim ,
To the manager of the
Surveillance technology , such as RFID , can be operated twenty-four hours without operators to track every detail about human activities .
What will the temperature be in the summer season in this area ?
However , if they have some special day like an important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which you have never seen before .
Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life , it sounds perfect , but we must face reality -- there is no Utopia .
THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT .
It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock .
The most suitable month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I am in charge of a project which starts in June so I am sure I could n't go later ) .
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a beginner and it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers .
They are filled with people who want to buy everything .
My friends lent me some money , but it was n't more than 120 pounds .
We would all prefer to go to the show ; free time is not so important for us .
A. Becker
This holiday will help me to think about it and prepare it .
I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected .
In conclusion , the advanced technology gives people the convenience to find their items and ensures their safety .
Since we have better living circumstances and higher quality of life , we are enjoying a longer life .
There could be many things to say about this .
The show will be about all the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and hairstyles .
Much violence that has happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resources .
The show is on Tuesday 14th between 10.00 and 13.00 .
Firstly , the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook , but he was not , it was another actor , who I have never seen before , so , as you can imagine , I was very disappointed .
In conclusion , for me , to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .
Hence , the country will face a big challenge to take care of the elderly .
In addition , for observation journeys and traveling , we only need to use RFID on certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit .
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars .
Besides that , an ageing population has an important and essential thing that we can not buy in cash .
The show started forty-five minutes late and this really disappointed me .
I 'm a shopaholic , but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable .
What do you think about this ?
People should be proud to have an ageing population because it is hard to achieve unless there are advanced medical technology and higher living standards .
Besides , we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulders , the older people .
I would also like to know how much money I can bring .
I wasted too much time waiting .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat a balanced diet to make themselves healthier .
Logically , it seems perfectly right .
In advance , thank you .
Dear M. Smith ,
Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
I had taken on very demanding work . I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders .
On the other hand , the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing ; each figure is the lowest record compared to the previous figure .
Nowadays , the media is expanding its means of communication so they need more information .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
However , the health level of the global population shows an increasing trend due to advancing medical technology and it leads to exponential growth in the number of elders worldwide .
When I work , I can hear my heart racing if I am doing something wrong or relaxing during work time .
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin , because it is more comfortable .
And , I have to return to my university by August .
Dear Helen Ryan
Therefore , this technology should be used to track people .
To sum up , with rising life expectancy , there exists both achievement and challenge .
And I checked his body condition .
I 'd like to ask some questions which I want to know .
People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but to keep claiming that their country is still safe .
In summary , the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like family problems or personal problems .
It 's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable .
REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY .
London is the place to be because there is always something happening .
In fact , shopping can have some disadvantages for different reasons :
Many industries throw their contaminated air away , without cleaning it first .
Many advantages have been shown in the areas like politics .
Over the years , it has helped humans to improve accessibility in the form of cards to gain access to certain places .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their standard of living ; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in a less stable situation .
I 'd better stop now .
However , not many young people are passionate about helping society or even helping the elderly .
Rising life expetancy best proves these improvements and has definitely written a new chapter in the history of human civilisation .
At that time , Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillance in every patient 's home to look after their actions .
13th June , 2000
If such a thing does happen , then society would be moving on a dangerous direction without noticing .
The high accuracy of surveillance technology eliminates the number of disagreements among people .
I just received your letter with the good news .
I would like to answer .
In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late .
Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is to protect us from criminals , nowadays , it seems to be used too much .
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to give something to someone .
Initially , surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) was implanted into the bodies of animals .
Isabel Cruz
For ancient people , it was miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is normal .
If RFID is used on everyone and runs for years , the surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistical data showing the movement of people from city to city , and from town to town , thus showing which city is expanding more than people thought , and which city is becoming less attractive .
In conclusion , there are challenges as well as achievement in rising life expectancy which we can not ignore .
Maybe paper can also be a fabric used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes every day .
We also do not want to see the worst outcome that parents are dropped by children in the street and let them die by themselves .
Furthermore , yesterday I heard that every man could fly into space without any experience , it is great , from my point of view , that in the year 2050 everybody will fly into space .
HE TOOK ME RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
Everybody knows everybody .
We find our family there and our life .
Although , video surveillance may be a help to most sectors , it can also be misused by many people .
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competition .
Therefore , the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive .
I am writing this letter to you , because the show `` Over The inbow '' , wh '' which L the London 's newest and best musical show , was not ... for me .
Thank You .
We have no experience but we would like to learn this game .
Both the library and museum apply this technology to avoid some belongings being taken out illegally .
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purposes , it is also used to track people through human implants .
While surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life , some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe .
I think that , ,having is a dream '' for all of us .
However , my family members do communicate with each other less than they used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank you for organising a school trip to London .
This job was quite hard , but we took our time to be not exhausted !
I am really happy to receive your congratulations .
Such a situation is major progress from ancient times and also a big achievement by all human beings .
Is it possible to get one there ?
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood , therefore I need a comfortable place to sleep .
Much more could be done to reach the stage of extending the lifespan of human beings .
So I can recommend you give her this book , because it is a very interesting , amusing , sometimes dramatic and mysterious book .
We do n't have to wear any special uniforms or signs of our school .
Yours sincerely ,
But it was closed .
So more manpower will be employed , which reduces labour in other areas .
I like shopping only with my best friend .
All her friends phoned her every day , except Pat , the only friend that Maria really loved . Despite that , she was not sad .
Being a security guard was the hardest task .
Although these bureaucratic actions have prevented another similar attack from happening again , the act is widely criticized for its violation of individual privacy .
THE REASONS ARE ; DISTANCE , LACK OF CAR , CROWDED STREETS , TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP .
I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Elderly people 's ability to move and act is much lower .
Sincerely
The show started late , at 20:15 , which was very different from '19.30 ' as shown .
Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon .
But at home you notice that there is a tear on the sleeve .
And you could n't of course take it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .
As previously mentioned there are benefits to these surveillance and tracking technologies .
Yours faithfully ,
Here , red things mean marriage and white means someone passing away .
I saw all the pop bands and singers .
The sports shop .
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London , especially for the river trip to Greenwich . It will be a great experience for us .
To begin with , you wrote in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance . In fact , there were only six countries involved .
It is a challenge that human beings can not avoid and must solve .
Therefore , we need to continue our striving as we try our best to reduce the adverse impact .
Healthcare is better than in the past .
For six months I 've worked in a McDonald 's restaurant in Italy and I 've got lots of money .
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with a simple design in the future .
Therefore , rising life expectancy can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
Anyway , it was a great experience in spite of these little problems .
More importantly , Singapore wants to be a knowledge-based country and more highly educated people are required .
To conclude , I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable .
As population ageing is increasing , as people are getting old , they need to be cared for by others and are not able to contribute as much as when they were young .
sincerely
Of course in the beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at it you 'll also earn some money .
Hence , people died of various diseases .
In the other words , it also can be said that it is an achievement to have an ageing population .
However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Dear Sir/madam
I can tell you I am only free in July .
I would like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere in which I will be living .
If we can not choose the proper way to use it , we will taste the bad consequences of it .
It is very dangerous for society , Because people do not know who is tracking them , it can cause citizens trepidation .
Regarding the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because it is more appropriate to a camp .
How could you arrange work like that ?
Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .
With best wishes , yours
For example , ordinary people should not be allowed to use it or allowed to access surveillance devices devices so that abusive usage of surveillance technology can be avoided . This is also an effective way to protect human rights .
Carrying big speakers from place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughs .
Moreover I would like to know what kind of clothes are the best for living in the camp and if I need to bring with me a large amount of money .
According to your advertisement I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies .
Yours faithfully ,
During the show I expected to see Danny Brook , who is my favourite actor , and Tina Truelove .
And for the second question .
What about accommodation ? I prefer tents to log cabins .
Now , technology and science has developed at an unbelievably fast pace .
Basically my work was carrying the instruments , the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage , which is not easy work because , as you can imagine , it 's not exactly light stuff .
I 'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize .
IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW .
If I had known all of them , I would have changed my plan and could have had a better time .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
Therefore , people are generally less stressed when working .
Can you believe it , it was Moby . So I went to say hello to him , and he asked me , 'Would you give me a hand with my decks ? ' So I went , and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row . Oh my God , Kim , that was the best thing that ever happened to me . Well Kim , I hope to receive a letter from you soon , and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything , thank you .
Every coin has two sides .
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give me my money back because in the advertisement there were some things that we did n't have in the theatre .
After this , it can automatically get the identification and .
Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actor on stage .
It all comes from my parents .
Please let us know as soon as you make your decision .
It was so exciting ! ! !
When the elderly live longer , the family size actually increases rather than decreases .
Everyone gathered in the disco at 21.00 .
Some people may claim that it is good for security when everyone is under surveillance becasue poteintial criminals also are .
It is progress of human beings that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancy , but it also is a potential crisis for both nations or human beings .
In that sense , without a proper way to track human beings , it is way too difficult to save the innocent life .
Dear Lucas !
I see a very different home for us in the future .
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries instead that from around the world .
I hope you understand me !
I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help to make our lives easier .
It would thus be a big challenge to the country as there would be no one boosting its economy .
First of all I want to wish your cousin a happy fifteenth birthday and wish her all the best .
I am really looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July , because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month .
As for the colours , I think metallic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster than in times past , when everything was sent by normal mail , and it was weeks till it got to the right place .
Vasiliy .
Do I have to bring any special clothes ?
In the long history of the evolution , we are always struggling for life against starving and illness .
Yours sincerely
Are there any activities which are not included ?
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructure , what kind of infrastructure and what other developments should be made .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
After the concert finished successfully , I was happier than ever because the success included my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life .
Oh , last I just would like to ask you how much clothing and money I have to bring with me .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose from impressed me the most .
First of all , I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July .
It was so exciting .
This is particularly seen in many parts of the world .
In order to bring more benefit and ensure people 's safety , surveillance technology has been utilized by many companies like in UPS and DHL . These express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods .
Unfortunately it is quite expensive , £32 .
With the help of RFID , if there is an emergency when people are crying for help , they would be saved .
In my opinion it would be nice if you created an exhibition space where the guests can try to play different instruments .
We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
How can you earn money in your spare time ?
Anyway , now I have to stop to finish my homework .
With information about the location of the cargo , it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company .
It will also induce many problems .

Would it not be similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space ?
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . I knew that he 's a very talkative person , but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for tenes .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Yours sincerely ,
It probably can be divided into several types .
It is difficult to keep the economy functioning well .
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
Although in many respects , this technology can be used in positive and evidently beneficial ways , in some areas it is so controversial .
I am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but they are my big passion
Because life and health are most significant , people have their own reasons to hope to live longer .
However I ca n't agree with the opinion that , ,Shopping is not always enjoyable '' I think that everybody likes to buy but not everybody likes to take pleasure in it .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
This is an age when most people are retired and have no source of income .
" The Big Brother is watching you " ( Orwell , ) . The fictional world described in George Orwell 's novel now turns out to be true .
Recently , some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London .
To sum up , everything you do in small quantities is good and fun , but do n't increase the amount you do if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .
Better sanitation will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
It was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day .
In conclusion , I have to declare that I and my fellow students will be available to help with this short video by all means .
I think you should check the information before printing it !
Dear Sir/Madam ,
How much money should I take with me ?
I have n't written to you for ages .
After that I turned on the car 's lights in order to warn the passing cars .
I think it 's a part of our life .
ON THE OTHER HAND , THERE WILL BE FEWER PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE .
I 've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax and to leave the city , which is very stressful .
We really like London , the people , the night-life but this evening was really awful .
It prevents children from sending them to an old folk 's home and not visiting them at all .
However , for some , these auto-tracking services break the principle of privacy .
Also , in August I will be studying a summer course in English .
One story is about ten people who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
True enough , their population is ageing but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming .
As the rise in life expectancy can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development , it can be seen as an achievement of human beings .
Policeman can just go to a certain place and chase the criminal .
Children could be easily found if they are lost or abducted by other people .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs .
More elderly people are a burden to society as more funds are required by the government to support their standard of living .
Moreover , some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that focus on the examination .
The great idea of making it `` international '' was unfortunately not brought said to life , because the artists ( mentioned to be `` from around the world '' ) were from only six countries .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
Our lives is not only exposed to Big Brother .
I was enthusiastic about receiving your letter .
I think a good way to get money is to work in a fast-food restaurant .
Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from , no , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , Adidas or Fila .
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were leaving and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to go by bicycle .
Due to its small size and energy-efficiency , it has become more and more popular in industry and logistics .
So ,
Thank you very much for your letter .
Libraries also use this technology to identify the membership of people entering , which ensures the security and the member itself will also conserve their information made in this library .
Yours sincerely
All passengers and pilots died .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where they also help to store the basic information of the patient .
Rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
They always find a problem .
From another perspective , there are more and more elderly people but fewer younger ones ; the increase in population age has weakened the labor force and so on .
It may incur a higher social cost burden which further leads to a greater allocation of funds in the government 's yearly budget .
Yeah ! ! !
12 Barcicka Str .
There were Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them .
However , we can take the essence and reject the dross .
how much money and should I pay by cash or by travel cards ?
With the installation of surveillance in every corner of Singapore , people 's life has safe security , and criminals are deterred by these electrical instruments .
In conclusion , we can see that in order to solve challenges such as the amount of illness that can grow over the years , due to the damage to our living environment and stresses that are always building in city life .
Moreover , almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology .
Since we do not need to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee , enormous time has been saved for everybody .
Such a nightmare is because of overuse of surveillance technology .
I was very disappointed after the show .
Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time using technology .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Moreover , the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing .
With a more perfect system with the older and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon .
With proper use of surveillance technology , it can be a good tool for the police , and also benefit all society .
Therefore I read Agatha Christie 's `` Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie '' .
One day she realized that I was always outside of the circle .
More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
On Friday evening and on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded .
Okay , I hope to have news from you very soon .
A possible benefit is better statistical analysis , which will provide the government with more information when drafting policies .
Basketball will help the children to build team spirit and leadership skills .
All the conditions , like the time of tracking and who can view your location , must be agreed to by the person who is being tracked .
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical started later than I expected so I was getting irritable because I very much dislike lateness , but that was not all .
Pressure can really cause sickness just like viruses and germs and it is more like a chronic disease .
Surveillance technologies should also not be used to infringe people 's liberty and freedom of opinion .
Thank you for everything !
Technology can be a very useful tool if it is used in the correct manner .
may be save the person 's life If their medical history is all recorded in the chip .
He wanted everything that his eyes saw .
Ongelina
Use the equipment and space that we have to organise some activities .
There was a sign in front of the restaurant : '' `` sorry are we closed for special reasons . And and I the reasons werefor was the reasons for that .
Additionally , you wo n't believe it , but the vocalist said `` All the chairs you are tting we wn onwe were set out by him , '' pointing at me ! !
We are all looking forward to your answer .
If we are talking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great - I love being close to nature .
I would like to ask about clothes .
We can not give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way to die and be reborn .
The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life , and then surveillance is not needed anymore .
They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children .
I think it can make your festival more popular .
She was so touched that we started to cry .
As this information is been well- kept by the operators because they encrypt the data and use it in its proper form .

Besides that , many animals which were just released from the long-term protection of humans were implanted with RFID as well to track their new life to ensure that they could survive in the wild .
Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .
Privacy must be respected , and power over others should be controlled .
During scientific explorations , especially geographical ones , tracking is very important .
Nevertheless , the activities I mentioned above are little related to privacy issues .
Dear Helen ,
Yours sincerely ,
In my opinion shopping is sometimes really boring , especially when you buy the same things at the supermarkets almost all the time , like cleaning products and the ingredients for everyday recipes .
Even if safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life , many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of the existance of some potential danger .
Before robots can fully replace labor , the decrease in generating power indicates less creativity and fewer goods available for us to use .
Rising life expectancy is a technological achievement .
Therefore , surveillance technology makes our society more law abiding .
Thank you for your letter .
Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theatre after the show .
Afterall , it might seem difficult to handle when the aging population of a country grows , especially the developed countries with a very small population .
How are you ?
However , when we look at the brighter side of the reality , the rise in life expectancy shows great improvements in various realms and solutions to many problems we had in the past . There is hope that the aging population may transform into a helpful force to the country in the future with the help of better technology and medication .
My exams will have finished at the end of June .
There were n't any discounts available as you 'd assured me in the ad .
I 'm not really sure about what kind of clothes to take . Could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable ?
I am writing to you about the show .
Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community , not only physically .
Probably the next breakthrough is around the corner in the near future .
This was a rare case since Singapore is actually an safe country .
She could n't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with .
I must insist that you refund the cost of the show .
It really disappointed me .
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .
Yours sincerely
I am writing to complain about a musical show on the 10th of June , and I was very disappointed .
As we can use resources with maximum efficiency , we can enjoy more and more life material then at any time of human society .
Since we are richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Secondly , for older people , more facilities and service for them will need to be provided .
It records history which nobody can deny .
Yours sincerely ,
Dear Manager ,
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE winner OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH .
The sales assistants in the stores are n't so nice or helpful .
With this advantage , it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they have lost contact or in an emergency and also for police to investigate crimes .
I am glad I have taken part in a few competitions , and I was so proud of our basketball team .
I swim really well and I am a professional basketball player .
Rising life expectancy is like a two-sided sword in the modern world .
I did not have a good time for all of these reasons and I would like you to give me my money back .
I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .
More than that , when I bought the ticket I did n't get any discount .
if you want to help , here is a list of what you can do . ''
When I find a new message , I 'm very happy .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
All the students are very pleased and we are looking forward to going to London .
However , the use of surveillance technology is usually done secretly , and debate has been generated recently whether surveillance technology should be abandoned .
My Mum was at home and I told her the whole story .
Dear Mr. Ryan ,
It is a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of .
No matter which reason stated above is responsible for rising life expectancy , it is evidence of the achievement of the human race .
People must make sure that the government is not abusing its power in ways that include tracking people .
Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephone .
This will save the customers time and also improve the profits of the supermarket .
Some have been widely accepted by the public but some are not .
Furthermore , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
Land space will be limited when more hospices are built to take care of the elderly people .
Two of the most important causes of the ageing problem are increasing longevity and declining fertility .
Thank you very much for the prize .
Therefore , we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation .
Dear Kim ,
I went to the theatre at 19.30 but , to my surprise , the show started at 20:15 and so I could n't remain there until the end because I had to leave London , with my group before the end of the show .
Dear Ms Ryan
At that time , even if there is no surveillance above people 's heads , there is surveillance in everyone 's heart and criminals have more difficulty to hide .
An individual is an unit of the society , every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society 's and nation 's growth .
I have got to go .
Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .
We do not want to be sued for infringing privacy ; therefore , before implanting any RFID , we should ask for consent .
After I told her I felt my feeling had been released and I was happy .
The technology is always improving and it never stops , and the lifespan of people is getting longer as well .
Also , not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down , but also jailbreakers .
In addition , people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked .
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES .
I felt unhappy sometimes .

A worse thing is that one may not even be aware of being tracked .
The problem that you have here is the weather .
Disabled people walk with artificial legs , man can get pregnant , even the sex of humans can be changed just by doing simple surgery .
As I did n't have a `` perfect evening out '' , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .
Another thing was that there were no discounts available , and that the restaurant , which I wanted to visit after the show , was closed because of the main cook .
Although it is not very comfortable , I like camping very much .
I started early in the morning , helping to carry stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played . I helped with the musical stuff like speakers , mics , lights , sound equipment , etc .
In China , things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough .
With good communication and interaction , an elderly person can guide the young with valuable lessons in life .
Would you tell me how much money you will give to me and what the weather is like in the U.S.A .
But , it was not possible .
Concerning the fashion of the future , I think it depends on people 's personalities and they develop their own styles which suit them the most .
I would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
However , growing life expectancy is also an achievement to human society .
It can provide an objective view of what happened .
During the show , I was very hungry but I hoped to visit the restaurant , which was a pity , because the restaurant was closed because it was too late .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID has even been invented to track people .
Back in ancient days when human beings first appeared on the earth , the average life expectancy was less than 20 .
But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?
I have to say that the evening was terrible .
Yours sincerely
IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT .
Pat could n't stand the pressure of the `` crime '' so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .
First of all , there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement .
I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop .
And other times they sometimes choose just for the label .
I count on my experience .
Rising life expectancy is also evidence of progress in modern medical technology .
I think I will enjoy myself in a tent .
I am writing to complain about your show .
There are two points supporting this argument .
Diana Delgado
If you need money and you need time for yourself try a job like that .
Thank you .
When the authorities treat liberty as a crime , society becomes terrible .
I strongly suggest you give us the right information .
I am particularly pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world .
Some days ago , when school was coming to an end , Pat and her friends decided to throw a party for their friend , Frances , because the end of the school term and Francis 's birthday were on the same day .
At the beginning I would like to answer the questions you asked me in your letter .
Improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises .
I am writing to you to tell you about my experience at a pop concert .
Yours sincerely ,
Besides , with the development of the technology , medical therapy has also had tremendous progress .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
I felt how lucky I was .
It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition , the people would have a good complexion .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there does exist many problems if it is prevalent .
It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death , thus living longer .
But in the breaks and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engineers , and I learnt something about setting up the equipment .
My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came .
Times change ; people change .
The increasing pressure will lead to declining fertility .
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information that you need from me to ensure that I have a good time at Camp California .
I have recently been to London for a week 's holiday .
For example , a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket .
We do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal .
What do students do now ?
Moreover , in your advert you wrote that there were discounts available but it was not the case .
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival I attended last weekend .
It is a very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class will enjoy .
Dear Kim ,
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help determine whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
I 'm writing to you in response to your letter . I was delighted to know that I won the first prize .
Thank you and greetings .
I 'm an Italian student who went to the last International Arts Festival .
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style . We might also get a chance to meet new people and interact with them .
For example , without surveillance technology , murderers could escape much more easily since no one would know their position .
Compared to human implants , tags on the products are better and more suitable .
It is clear that problems that may be faced by developed and developing countries are different .
Hello Kim ,
How is the weather in California ?
Dear Helen
I think technology has changed my life and the way of life of almost everyone around the world .
But his nose moved quickly when the police showed him a picture of the bank robbers .
Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs ?
Yours sincerely
Radio-frequency identification is a technology which uses a wireless non-contact system to scan and transfer the data from a tag attached to people or products with a radio-frequency electromagnetic field .
Yours sincerely
I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid coming into contact with them .
Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented , their lives have been far easier than before .
Rising life expectancy can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life , bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
Actually it spoiled our time .
With the development of science and technology , people nowadays are living under various types of surveillance ; for example , CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public areas .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Marcella , Scalia C .
13 July 2000
We are ready to give up our shopping and free time .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
And my last question : how many people are going to stay in each tent .
We asked Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
This seems to be gratifying progress at the first sight .
So , I had no perfect evening out and I want my money back .
I will never forget that summer day .
Looking forward to hearing from you
After going through the WW1 and WW2 , the population on the earth got much fewer .
Especially to the science museum because we are all doing science in school .
It was not good for me , because I had only one weeks holiday in London .
Only the police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help track murderers or suspects .
I made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha 's friends with a note : '' `` Do not tell Agatha out this at . This surprise . Pleasek a suprise party for her , please keep the secret ! ''
The condition of the living environment has also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places .
Surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious .
Then the police realized who the bank robbers were and arrested them .
Moreover , as we use up more and more resources , what we have left may not be enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resources to research and develop new technology .
We started our journey and we arrived at our destination by 6 o'clock in the evening .
To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes need to be built , which add on to the expenses of society .
We were mainly working on all the lights at this great concert .
I am writing with regard to your advertisement .
A major source of the hazards is pollution .
Although the current world is a digital world in which more machines are used to replace manpower , manpower is required to operate these machines so that they can better function .
Dear Kim ,
These fields are special because of the job category , and the need to be open to the public , so the disadvantages will not be apparent .
SO , I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER .
Therefore , if a business man wants to defeat his competitor , he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious and has gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as resource allocation .
This creates a huge social burden for them and might cause some of them to leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable .
This shows the importance of experience .
Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert .
Another situation is when you have to buy somebody a present .
It happened last summer . We planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we could n't tell our parents because they would n't allow us to go .
It was very interesting .
Dear Sir/Madam ,
Lausanne , the 20th of May 2000
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' .
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
In the first place , every civilized person more or less dislikes the idea that he or she is being closely watched every second .
On one side , we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the crime rate .
The question is : Do I need some extra money and what kind of clothes should I take for this trip ?
But I think that there are limits .
I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible .
I would also like to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip .
The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from what was promised in the advertisement .
I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing .
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show that we saw advertised and we are interested in .
Today , surveillance technology has become almost ubiquitous wherever we go .
Love ,
Government will also have a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
Surveillance technology is one of the main concerns of the military and national defense sectors .
In addition , it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed .
It 's funny .
Another human identification is Implanting RFID chips into human body .
However , I think such powerful devices should not be made easily available to the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned ' individuals .
On my first day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
And how much money do we need to take ?
I do not like crowded places .
However , as energy and resources are used up , more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem , so the rise in life expectancy can also be seen as a challenge .
In addition , if surveillance technology becomes even better developed , it could be used to detect problems before real accidents occurs .
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever experienced .
Fewer young people and more elderly people exist globally .
I hope we can catch up with each other 's news .
These two words can be seen in various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
Juliana Piotrowska
yours faithfully
The first one is that rising life expectancy can be considered a challenge .
Personally , I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology , such as RFID , should be used to track people .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their living ; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses have died ; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
Their safety may be greatly compromised .
Therefore , surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life .
I went into their room and gave hot Cheeseburgers , Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter .
The headmaster would not know how the teacher really is and she would not fire her even if some children were afraid of entering the teacher 's class .
It is called `` The London Fashion and Leisure Show . ''
Yours faithfully ,
In my opinion , the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service .
I 'd appreciate it a lot .
First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A only in July because of my university .
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMME , WE SUGGEST GOING TO THE SHOW ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY , INSTEAD OF FREE TIME , VISITING THE SCIENCE MUSEUM .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , population aging has become a problem , especially in the developed countries .
Personally I dislike computers .
At the beginning I would like to thank You for Your letter - it pleased me much .
Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children .
The second day 's objective was to install the stage .
It was my dream to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , so it is still my dream because of your show .
And that is always what we want .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accident , diseases or suicides .
It will be great for me to do basketball in the USA .
Finally , the day of the concert came .
I hope everything around you is alright .
The reason is that we have long holidays at school at that time .
With modern machines and growing methds , humans do not need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
I 'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition .
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets . They were lists of pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order , and some information about their performance and backgrounds .
Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
We might even be able to open the door without leaving the living room .
It would explain why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
An ageing population is a consequence of the increasing health level of the population .
I am looking forward to hearing from you
Taken together , we should say that rising life expectancy is two-sided .
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said none was available .
I 'm writing to you inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I went to your theatre to see the play called `` OVER THE RAINBOW '' .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rules and cycles , which is a big challenge faced by human beings .
My conclusion on these points is not so bad .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated , people do not risk their lives anymore .
Although in those days the only way of learning was reading .
First of all , we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition .
It was such a disappointing evening out with my friend during our week 's holiday in London .
In the past , people could only find each other and communicate face to face .
On the other hand , there are people who think the opposite , such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they hardly ever go shopping - only when they need clothes , or something for their job or school .
First , if the older people increase , there will be a smaller workforce that can support society .
I look forward to hearing from you .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of logistical hassle .
The media is starting to encroach into the private life of these famous people .
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings .
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs .
Then you invited people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there were no staff to welcome people .
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view , because we can study the subject 's reactions before , during and after shopping .
A bad mood can not give them a longer life .
But I was really disappointed by it .
But , well , the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets .
Finally , we would like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the brochure .
The government should help encourage breakthroughs as well as a complete medical system .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient environment for human beings .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
We waited for ages because we had not been informed .
I was very upset because the show had many problems .
If you go to the centre of any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
People were worried about the loss of privacy .
After that , I would like to say Thanks , I have never won any prizes at all .
And referring to the question about which type of accommodation I prefer , I choose a log cabin , because I think that a tent is messier , so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin .
I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class .
He stayed looking at me and laughing .
It 's really useful when I need a quick reply .
Where every home houses an elderly person , the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and moral values .
In any period of time , as long as we do not offend others , we should enjoy the right of privacy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consume large quantities of energy .
For example , one person wants to visit his friend 's place in a new city .
Thank you very much for everything .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people .
I am therefore writing to give you my further information .
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you , no one to talk to and no one to complain to .
Now population aging is a trend .
I would really appreciate it if you could answer these questions and saying again .
No matter where people go , taking bus or MRT , people are on the CCTVs . It is very important and useful to track and find people .
I have been asked to write a composition regarding the questionIt is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable .
But when I was fifteen my favourite book was `` The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie '' .
Yours faithfully ,
Rising life expectancy may be due to several different reasons , for example , it may be because of the improvement in living conditions or because of the upgraded cleanliness of the living environment , or because of the wide range of nutrition that is absorbed by humans , or because of the development of the medical system in the country .
In summary , surveillance technology should not be used to track people in order to keep society comfortable and safe to live in .
It 's a great opportunity for us because there will be exhibitions of the latest fashions , of the new hairstyles , and of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to apply make-up .
Let foreign students do more exercises about English to help them pass the exam .
However , he was not on the stage that day .
DEAR SIR ,
Pat 's story
The government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it .
The readers just smile when they flip the page because it never comes to their minds that one day it might come true .
It made me sad .
DANNY BROOK is one of my favourite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me .
I received your letter two days ago and I 'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E .
Yours Sincerely
I think it 'll also be very different from now .
People are getting more and more lonely .
In addition , elderly people are using the same or even more social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
But tracking people is very terrible choice . It sounds like people invented a 'prison ' to jail themselves . People need respect and freedom .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , I would be grateful if you could arrange accommodation for me in log cabins as I am not used to staying in the countryside and especially not in tents .
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage .
I can come to USA in July because in August I will be working with my father .
I had to wait in the overcrowded hall .
Due to all these reasons , people died quite early , which resulted in a lower life expectancy .
Thank you very much for your last lovely letter .
The next minute , I may have tea with my manager .
Besides , tracking potentially dangerous people will be helpful for the safety department to predict harm and better avoid problems .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people and may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
Vasiliy Alekseyev .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violate the privacy of people instead of being used in a more beneficial way , it is my opinion that such technology should be rethought .
So , when employees begin to resist this tracking system , they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement for the governments .
I could n't have all the things I expected .
I am very proud that I won first prize in your competition and I am extremely happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A .
I 'm glad to receive your letter .
My work consisted in checking the tickets , the number on them and taking people to their seats .
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming that I won the first prize in your competition .
Sir manager ,
We can imagine that when the life expectancy raises , this will mean that the average age of the population nationally or globally is also rising .
However , among the under-developed countries , developing countries and developed countries , we found that there is the longest life span in the developed countries , followed by the developing countries , and the shortest life span in the under-developed countries .
On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancy will cause a larger population .
In a nutshell , surveillance technology may provide a lot of convenience if it is used appropriately .
The other activity I would like to do is tennis , I 'm quite good at it and I have been playing for four years .
There is no doubt . Tracking systems have brought many benefits in this information age .
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it 's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available .
In order to cope with an ageing population that pulls down or hinders economic development , more physically capable and young workers are required in society .
We had a fantastic time together for three months .
So according to humanism , people should make a contribution to improving human life . people should consider feelings because one day when they will be becoming older and older . So , respecting life should be considered carefully .
But if there is a problem because the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same time as our shopping trip , I suggest going shopping on Wednesday afternoon when we will not have anything to do !
For men , sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners .
After that , I had to help people who had a ticket but could n't find their seat .
There are a series of problems that hinder longevity such as current medicine .
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best I would pay what they asked .
Yours faithfully .
What can I say about television ?
He told me about a concert programme and gave me his photo with an autograph .
This is because of two reasons . One is the strict law in Singapore , and the other is the dense surveillance everywhere .
BESIDES THIS , I COULD NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED .
You had to be disappointed .
This is not a simple question because I have been used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain to you how .
xxx
Hackers have become increasingly vicious , invading our computer systems . Now radio-frequency tracking devices may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons .
BUT SOME PEOPLE DO N'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL .
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong , the resources are very limited , especially land .
We have benefitted from surveillance technology for many years and in many ways .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
They feel stressed under the control of the government and it may lead to consequences that we do not desire and imagine .
Best wishes
Faithfully Yours
Misha ( 2008 ) explains in his book 'McMafia ' that the shadow market accounts for 20 % of the global economy .
Sometimes , older people need more manpower and resources than normal young people .
I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Therefore , surveillance technology provides convenience to society but causes more inconvenience to individuals .
This also prevents normal hackers from getting this information that was recorded for proper usage for unlawful usage .
I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY GROUP , AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING US ABROAD .
It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keep growing as people do sicken every moment .
Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies ?
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
I had to take care of them during the break , serving drinks , clothes , I even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted .
About accommodation , I would prefer a log cabin , because I have a problem with my back .
Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
I am writing to complain about the musical `` Over which the Rainbow '' , that I went to see on the 16th of June .
However , in your letter you mentioned some activities .
Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an aggressive employee refused to answer me .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the number of rooms should not change either .
If everyone is being watched unknowingly , it seems that our freedom of doing things is compromised .
In the first place , it must have achieved an advanced health care system .
First of all , dishwashers are very convenient for me because I work full-time and look after my children .
17 June 2000
I am good at playing tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be useful training for me .
We used to tell everything to each other .
When I was a child I had different entertainment to those that modern-day children have .
Examples that are hypothetical and yet concrete are action spy movies , such as the Bourne Identity .
There was a note on the door saying that painting was going on that weekend .
All this technology advancement has also helped to improve the lives of the human race in terms of improving the lifestyle , environment and medical ability .
Basically , I do n't like staying in a small tent .
In addition , although you advertised that discount tickets were available , they do not sell them any more according to your staff .
So , I started to speak in English with him .
Moreover , these older people usually contribute less or have nearly no productivity in society .
But before the application , governments need to secure the safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen , probably by a gypsy .
First of all , I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during that month .
An example of this technology is RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people .
I believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results .
Because I am a student and in June , I will still have school .
Studies have shown that the average life span of humans has been rising gradually over the years , in the sense that the global improvement of technology in medicine has helped humans to live longer and enjoy the world even more .
Technology is always improving to catch up with the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or military to track people down .
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen .
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for students like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show was meant to start at 19.30 but on that day it was delayed about 45 minutes .
Now none of Pat 's friends tell her about their secrets because Pat is n't very good at keeping secrets .
The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more comfortable than in a tent .
Nothing was serious .
On the other hand , I will also discuss how RFID can be utilized for good purposes .
This shows rising life expectancy ; it is an achievement and it is also a challenge .
XXXX
With reference to the date , I can only go in July , as I 'm going off on holiday in August , and I start university in September .
From my point of view , the real question is : Who said that is enjoyable ?
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals and find the location of the lost elderly person in a shorter period of time .
This will lead to more crimes and threaten our privacy .
I spent two days there , and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been to .
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sun-glasses , and that all the masks are designer brands , which are made of a special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air .
He always tried to say nothing and did .
Last month I enjoyed helping at the concert of `` Modern Talking '' and now I want to share with my e my experience .
THEY CAN SAY , ,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE '' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD FROM CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER .
People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies .
I must wash the dishes from time to time ( I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty ) and clean our house .
Some have questioned whether a society under close surveillance will be a good one to live in .
But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it !
I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team , and photography is my favourite hobby .
Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage during the play .
I look forward to hearing from you
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to society .
In this instance we are going to focus on me :
In addition , it can also prevent theft .
'As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions .
There is no denying that every coin has two sides .
It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the financial security of old people .
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT 19.30 AND I WAITED FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES ! !
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for autographs .
For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by Internet or by telephone .
However , besides tracking goods for people , people could use this technology to track people .
In economics , we can use GDP to explain the challenge . If GDP is low , it shows that most of the people are living a hard life . Quality of life is bad , then it will cause terrible social problems and at last , it will cause social disturbance .
Really he was bad .
Dear Sir ,
However , based on humanism , humans are different from the animals . People should respect all life .
Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs , some of which I put in the envelope .
I understand you want to know when I am available to set off and where I 'd like to stay .
There has always been a solution because of the achievements that have been done by humans who used their time to improve our basic needs and life for the living and extend our life expectancy .
Power is concentrated in a few people .
Imagine that all the people have hats with broad brims to protect their faces from the sun , and it 's the trendiest fashion of the year !
A balanced phenomenon should be seen in one nation .
I 'm writing to complain about the service you 'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre .
Manela B .
You should return my money immediately because that night was far from perfect .
When he was out he needed to buy some cigarettes so he went to the shop where the owner , his friend , asked him if he was very happy about his present , the new gold watch , he was very lucky to have best friends like Pat and her friends .
However , this way of curbing crimes is so violating that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the tracking of such devices .
With filial morality , most of the children will take care of their parents after the parents ' retirement .
With the advanced medical skill we have nowadays , humans live longer and hence , there is a great increase in population .
I want to thank you once more for taking me into consideration in your competition .
We do not think enough about our offspring .
Our suggestion is that you could change the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon .
Please let me know if you agree with us !
AT THE SAME TIME , WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING .
In this , I mean that we can implant this device into animals or birds , to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime .
Competition Organiser
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied with your information and I ask for some money back .
The most controversial part may be human identification .
I would also be grateful if you could send me information about the average cost of living in California , as I have to work out the amount of money that I am going to spend , and some advice about the clothes that I need .
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILY ( IT 'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM , TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER , LUNCH OR BREAKFAST ) .
So I was really surprised .
In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say that I am quite good at climbing .
Soon after coming into the industrial age , humans released a weapon and starts a new technological era .
In my opinion , shopping is relaxing , above all on Saturdays when you have finished a working week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday .
As the standard of living increases , the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies , which have advanced over the decades , among the general public has become increasingly available .
( CNN , 2011 ) . However , only one year has passed and most of the survivors have come back to their normal lives although with sad memories .
The overcrowded modern cities also raise problem of public transportation , unevenly distributed wealth and education resource shortages are the problems that some countries may have face to .
Mr John Smythe ,
However , the need for food is also increasing , so the competition might become even more frightening .
And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives .
Basketball because I am very good at it , swimming because I like to swim very much but I 'm not a very good swimmer .
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I could n't have dinner after the musical because the restaurant was closed .
The ageing population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to encourage a healthy lifestyle in the population .
This kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto-track you and you would not be able to run away from them .
Shopping is boring if you go with people who are too fussy .
For example , if the tracking technology is able to track everyone , even strangers , this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online .
Although someone could say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose , the tags are still not appropriate .
It can benefit mankind if appropriately used .
Secondly , in the advertisement it said that discounts were available but there was no discount on the tickets I bought .
Dear Kim :
Xavier Fournier
It is stupid . They do not have any goal .
Human rights have been raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also living with them .
I am very surprised to have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won a prize in your competition .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standards and medical care , countless people 's lives have been extended .
In modern society , privacy is a hot topic in peoples ' minds .
Anyway I 'm not very good at surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can do it .
With more advanced technology in medicine , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of the others will be familiar to us .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
In the afternoon she had phoned Francis 's mother and she told her the secret , then she phoned her best friend and she spoke about that again ; she phoned many people all day .
People of the developed nations are likely to be well-taken care of , partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by their respective governments .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some ways ; however , when it violates the privacy of people , it is unacceptable .
One problem is that people are not sure who is in charge of these tracking systems .
I 'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised .
I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition .
We can also suggest how the original programme can be changed .
YOURS FAITHFULLY
I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for repairs .
Organise your shows better and do not exaggerate with publicity !
By using this card , our identities can be confirmed and the information of a certain institution can be kept .
As a general trend , elderly people are more likely to be ill as compared to young capable adults .
This will help the country to move forward rapidly .
Nowadays , technology is more advanced than in the past .
For instance , it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T-shirt although you do not buy anything .
With the help of internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me the chance to improve my English .
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE MUSICAL IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY .
Without give really importance to the quality , because people in general do n't spend time preparing food and when they go shopping they choose pre-prepared food .
Firstly , we got our tickets at your ticket office just one hour before the show .
Much of this surveillance is being implemented in government sectors , or military areas to enhance their security .
Our suggestion is to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday .
The modification was so obvious that people could easily recognize .
Rising life expectancy results in a smaller available workforce .
Firstly , although treatment is reliable , people would still need to have awareness of their own health condition .
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request .
With the popularization of surveillance technology , more concise and more complete regulations of using it are highly needed .
In addition , people tracking systems may be used by bad people in a wrong way .
But , as the days went by , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used to not telling secrets anymore .
Many factories could be deserted and many companies could go bankrupt , and thus people 's life condition will definitely get worse .
This is the interpretation of the challenge of rising life expectancy .
You might understand how excited I was .
Not only the families of the old people , but also the government need to put a lot of effort into handling such a situation .
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time .
On the other hand , I am keen on painting , however , I have never painted in my life , so I would like to try it .
But also there are some notes that you should improve in next year 's festival to make it absolutely wonderful .
I think sleeping in a tent is more fun than other .
Pat was worried , she did n't know what to do .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancy can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
I hope that the next time you will come with me !
I could n't believe it when he said : `` O.K .
However , to a certain extent , I agree that implanting RFID tags on products can protect the safety of children .
On the whole , I was really disappointed at that time .
Because my course wo n't finish until the end of June , and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term .
However , RFID in our purchases will violate our right of privacy .
Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever receive !
I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs , even though the owner is far from the house .
However , there are two sides of the issue .
It had already closed when the show finished .
It was so boring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
It was a big one and I could n't have imagined how amazing it was .
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures .
Then there comes a problem .
Famous People & the Media
It would be great if life expectancy keep rising up day by day , but in reality , it does not seem to be so ideal .
Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .
Prisoners ' privacy is threatened due to the use of .
An ageing population is often viewed negatively by developed countries that are economically oriented .
On the other hand , people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a `` family '' .
Then I had a chance to speak with them .
Dear Tom ,
I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming .
More exercise or any other forms of workout can prolong the lifespan of people .
About accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp , I would prefer a log cabin ; because maybe it is more interesting to share with other people .
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years .
I almost forgot to mention that it is free for students !
Yours sincerely ,
Moreover there were no discount tickets .
Without an advanced health care system , aged people have a higher rate of death .
As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in those activities .
But I will not tell you any more .
I enclose my phone number and address .
In my opinion , modern technologies play an important role in people 's lives .
To conclude , the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement in economics , medical skills and living standard .
Moreover , the money spent on the telephone call database is $ 1.8 million per year .
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUND BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY .
" The weak is meat and the strong eat it " does not apply nowadays .
Well , you can look at your house ... Nowadays , we have all kinds of instruments for washing up the dishes , for cooking to be more convenient , for example , the TV , the video recorder , etc .
An important feature of RFID is the minimal security .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully
I would like to travel in July to California .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about the advantages it offers human beings .
A fire started in the air cargo to a Valujet plane after the plane had taken off .
If even pets are granted freedom , people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential .
Are you afraid ?
I think they are so hospitable and warm with people around them .
Yours faithfully ,
See you .
This is a natural law which nobody can violate .
The woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me , actually she started swearing at me .
I did n't know what was my responsibility until they called me to be trained .
same also applies to technology .
As a result , people have more time to enjoy the advantages of modern life .
The most important part is health care and old-age pensions .
It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
All of these problems are waiting to be resolved .
Now in Singapore , we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown .
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually .
I do n't think there is anything I 'd like to change .
FINALLY I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID `` THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS , JU YOU ARE LOOKING FOR , JUST FOLLOW ME '' .
Oh , sorry they were not on this road . They were on the next road .
There are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time .
Then all the girls became jealous and stopped laughing .
Contrarily , it can help to monitor public figures in politics and track offenders in security .
Everybody knows that , ,present presents a problem '' You know your own taste but what about the taste of the other person ?
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn some money and have fun at the same time .
So , I think there is n't anything I 'd like to change .
They waste their time .
That 's men 's intention .
We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement .
Last year I took part in a photographer 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the category of , ,beautiful scenery '' .
In addition , I would like to inform you that I would prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I am at the camp , as I am an active member of the Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you soon .
People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally .
In the advertisement , you mentioned actors , time , discount and facilities .
So , I hope I will get my money back . It was a very disappointing evening in my life !
So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me .
I am writing to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the trip that I have won in your competition .
In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and then we can go to the show .
And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ?
I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake .
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I come to your theatre .
Nowadays students have many more facilities in education than before .
Surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population is potentially a dangerous weapon of the governments against their own people .
It contains a wide range of activities , for example , sightseeing , a river trip , visiting the science museum and gallery , shopping .
Furthermore , such tracking of individuals is done without the permission of the subject person .
Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time .
This method may violate certain people 's rights and privacy , but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society .
I have sent you a photocopy of our tickets .
Patients in many developing and less developed countries , especially African countries , are suffering from simple and easy-to-cure diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day , it becomes the end of their life , although they could have been treated better if they were in a country where the medical system is complete and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people .
NOWADAYS , PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORRIED .
However , an ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure .
I have found it very expensive to buy them but there are a number of advantages .
Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but that is not always the case .
DEAR MR ROBERTSON
With the power of the Internet , it is not impossible to find a friend for afternoon tea .
From one perspective , it shows that medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different diseases .
I was having some family problems , so my marks were going down and down .
It may help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people commit crimes .
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday .
Would you like to live in a modern way ?
The secret was about a surprise party for her best friend 's birthday .
The nightmare started at this time .
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had . I was on holiday in London and I did not have enough time to spend there , but when you said that your show was the best I decided to go .
With RFID , the customer who is considering buying a very expensive luxury item will be less reluctant to consider the possibility of losing it , because RFID can help them get it back .
It was written that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove .
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
The ambulance can get there as soon as possible to save them .
This clearly illustrates how a corrupt government may breach its civilians ' privacy .
Can you tell me if it is necessary to bring any special clothes . For instance if I go surfing will I need a wet suit .
Thanks for your attention and we 're waiting for your answer .
Another problem is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
Some good examples such as the Internet , computers and satellites are now quite common in humans ' normal life ; however , some problems have also emerged , with a concern for the loss of the privacy of civilians .
People with rising life expectancy would ensure a large population and more variation in human beings .
My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .
More variation in medical treatments is required to help increase the life expectancy of humans .
Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes .
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using .
We turned off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard `` What the hell is going on ? ! ! ''
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing . I have n't done a lot of it but I 've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better at it .
Dear Kim
I stand against the idea of tracking individuals given the vulnerabilities of the technology at present .
For example , it can be a very beneficial and useful device for the force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .
The following paragraphs have more specific explanations .
There is one question I would like to ask you about the Camp .
Population ageing is now a heated topic in individuals ' lives .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupted because of illness .
I think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it is n't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
I felt very disappointed .
Now a lot of people knew the secret but Pat told everyone : `` will I tell you a small secret , but do n't you speak about it , please ! ''
Although all that may happen our houses may be still the same .
Imagine there is no CCTV in public .
Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for entertaining but I wish I 'd not gone there because everything went wrong .
It began when our mutual friend Martha offered me the chance to help organise the concert . Obviously I accepted .
It will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show .
This may lead to the younger 's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower standard of living to reduce daily cost .
Dear Mr. Clark ,
We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course !
Dear Sir/Madam ,
How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused ?
I do n't know if technology has totally changed my life , because I was born with it and I have learned about it since I was a little boy .
Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad .
This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Personally , I think surveillance technology such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people , for the benefit it brings to me can not match the concerns it causes .
Every coin has two sides .
I especially liked that time .
Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .
It is highly plausible that the reasons for the increase are the same as the developed countries .
Working with this band was an experience I will never forget .
I am a foreign student who is on holiday here .
Lastly , I think that all these changes wo n't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly .
In the supermarket , monitors are needed because we have to track thieves .
As the RFID is embedded within the product , people who have the access to the information definitely can track him .
It is a common question asked by lots of people that even though the technology is developing and we benefit from it , we are losing our privacy .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
First the show started at 10.15 , and it should have started at 19.30 .
Leasing private information , even if it only happens one time , is one too many for an individual .
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yesterday .
Approval of RFID tracking can be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us , especially in planning all this programme in such an accurate way .
The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people 's wisdom and creativity , which is decreasing due to population aging .
The detective will start investigating the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities .
I know it 's my fault .
So I hope I have helped you .
Due to the three major factors stated above , people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments , are able to cure diseases considered fatal previously and do not need to do much labourous work .
By the way , I would like to know about the shopping , especially for clothes . I want to buy some for myself .
However , once the government gathers too much power , democracy may be turned into totalitarianism , and surveillance technology provides the means .
Dear Mrs Ryan !
So rising life expectancy can be regarded as proof of what we have done to combat for ourselves .
Instead , when the installment of such devices was released in the newspaper , it was heavily criticised by the public .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research has also been widely used in many countries .
Yours faithfully .
Although the bank robbers complained to Pat , he had n't said anything to anybody .
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make himself known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .
Looking forward to hearing from you .
50 years ago , Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food .
In the old times , people could easily lose their life due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
I think that this show will be a great opportunity for all of us while we are in London .
I 'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view , have n't they ?
It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working .
Dear Kim :
First of all , it was written in the advertisement for the show that the main actor would be Danny Brook , but a different actor played in the show .
I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams .
This could cause a drastic fall in their economy if the younger generation could not take over their work .
One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp , deep look , never have I seen such a deep look , and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .
THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRLFRIENDS .
Does society need surveillance or not ?
What is more , modern technology prevents different illnesses .
8 Jun 2000
But there were a lot of things which went wrong .
Despite the huge advantages , technology has affected our lives negatively .
First of all , the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove . Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
That is to say , people will be surveilled every moment without their awareness .
He promised to keep it secret . The next morning we had an argument with Pat . The 3 of us were shouting at each other . In short , Pat left us .
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
There was no discount at all , which was in contrast with 'Discounts Available ' .
However , there are situations where we have to consider rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement .
Over the Rainbow , which you advertised .
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how grateful I am .
Would it be possible to go to the Museum and then go shopping in our free time , which is on Wednesday ?
Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
It may be a challenge but also a golden opportunity to educate children properly to prevent undesired outcomes .
In my opinion , the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction , which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation .
Therefore , every country should try to keep both the young and old generations balanced .
But there 's something that I 'd like to ask .
As people who are incapable of production become more and more , our society could follow a downward trend .
Already without these technologies , the secret police agencies are able to track their prey and unsuspecting rebels .
The challenge of many ageing countries will increase when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade .
Additionally , the service industry also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees .
I hope everything is good in your family and your school .
As it becomes highly developed , it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where you go and what you do .
DEAR Helen Ryan ,
Climbing , in contrast , is something I started a few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
Yours sincerely
It 's good that he is far away ...
If you work in a fast-food restaurant you can work in the afternoon , or during the night , and so you have time for yourself .
First of all on Tuesday we will all go to the show and spend all day there , but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have some free time we can go to the Science Museum , if you do n't mind , of course .
But nevertheless I decided to go to your show .
Rising life expectancy is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
It took quite a long time to adjust to the multi culture in the language institute .
Above is all the information you asked for . However , there are some things I 'd like to know ; the first is about the clothes . What kind of clothes do I need to take with me ?
Tracking people is one way of abusing technology and in fact , it happens every day .
Compared to the past , it is a big step forward in the development of medical science .
Only in this way can we get evidence of bad acts to protect others .
I will give you some information which will help you to know me better .
This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice .
Thank you for choosing our ticket at the final .
I would be most grateful if you could give me further advicable information .
Otherwise shopping would be more enjoyable .
We could even make a trip to Paris in the school holiday !
So , in the following paragraphs , I will clarify these two different views of rising life expectancy .
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago .
Is there any possibility we could rent golf shoes ?
Some people have started to wonder if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and outperform human beings .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack of labourers .
I would be very grateful if I could get my money back .
They have full control of their own lives .
In addition , Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which mainly consist of services .
However , this rising life expectancy has become a challenge and also an achievement in healthy ageing .
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area , but of course with all the facilities to get there , like a big supermarket and mall centre , from different areas of the city .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it threatens their privacy or personal life .
TO CONCLUDE , I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK .
Without approval , people should not able to use this technology to track others .
PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY .
Logistics and transportation are major areas of utilization for RFID technology .
I hope this letter contains all the information you need from me .
In this way , the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion Show .
As far as camp activities are concerned , I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years and , for that reason , I am fairly interested in sailing .
Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Because the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased .
However , the world has always been beyond our imagination and has never let us down .
We need CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious behavior .
In addition , old people are weakened in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as workers .
Without a doubt , surveillance technology violates the right since it leaks people 's information without getting their permission .
We have modernized and we have gained improved living standards and medical care .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed the most .
The government needs to seriously consider normal people 's privacy. .
Moreover , the use of RFID chips in tracking clothes also very common sight in the service industry becaue of the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked at any one point .
The police seize criminals thanks to CCTV .
It was my day , I am sure about it .
First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his acting .
Best wishes .
Humanity can be best seen in the case of rearing pets .
ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT , NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE .
Dear Ms Ryan ,
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the staff and also every day I was backstage supporting the catering staff .
Afterwards , I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store .
People will act as if there is no supervision .
Thank you for your last letter .
To pay this extra money , government will place higher taxes on other people .
Because technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just did not live a long life .
The ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies .
RFID is one of the advanced technologies for tracking .
A survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people 's living standard has improved .
Although rising life expectancy is an challenge to the entire human ace , the detailed problems that each country will encounter are different .
I hope to hear from you soon
Food can be a big part of our lives .
I look forward to hearing from you .
When people start to age , many diseases will surface unnoticed .
However , when it happens , it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and a reduced labor society .
I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the 'international arts festival . '
We think it is a great opportunity to see the latest fashions , and find out about make-up and hairstyles .
In other words , it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective and well-managed by the Government .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
We could n't have a drink .
I have just received the letter , which lets me know that I have won the first prize .
I was sure this was London 's newest and best musical show , the best I would ever see , because of the good publicity you gave yourself in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
Pat did n't say anything .
Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - have been doing different things .
This technology leads to a problem which is the same one in the prisoner issue , that is human privacy .
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon .
First of all because of the great variety in the store .
Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
The pop band `` Five '' ved in into town with building and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound .
Cancers , a major group of killing diseases , is often beyond current medicine to get fully cured .
So if I could travel in July , and come back before the 6th of August , that would be great .
The sightseeing by bus , in particular , seems to be very interesting .
I must say that the International Arts Festival is really a great idea .
I am a life guard and I could work in your camp as a rescuer next summer .
Can you imagine ?
This leads to an escalation of your anger .
Many people , especially women , love shopping .
We spent hours on this till it was good enough for the technical manager .
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th to the London Fashion and Leisure show , instead of the science museum and shopping .
Therefore , we must agree before the technology is able to track us .
However , I 'm happy that we have finished this hard work .
And did you notice something about fashion of the future ?
The rooms and sizes should remain as they were and the living rooms and everything may still be decorated in the same style .
So , you could understand how disappointed I was .
In the United States , after the horrible attack on 11 September , the US Congress passed the Patriot Act , which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance as a counter against terrorism .
Thus , it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training inexperienced workers .
The application of surveillance technology is the most effective method to track people and thus can help the police a lot .
I 'll be looking forward to hearing from you .
Technology is a wide field which expands very quickly .
I hope you will continue holding your festivals .
The fourth day , the singers and the musicians were there to test .
Some parents would be too busy to take care of the children while other parents would not believe what the children had said .
I think I ca n't forgotten this experience on my mind
See you soon .
Third , there was no possibility of a discount .
I had wanted to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some nights ago ; and the actor Danny Brook 's performance .
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in society and the portion of working adults is reduced .
It is technological developments that enabled the improvement of living conditions ; the discovery of food and nutrition that is more suitable and more necessary for humans to absorb ; the various medicines that can be used to cure different diseases .
Therefore , achieving such a great feat in these areas is considered an achievement because human lives have been improved and extended .
Think about it .
If the famous person does n't mind being filmed in his personal life there 's no problem .
My parents are very kind , and they know that their son will do everything right .
Everyday crimes happen from time to time , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combination of ethical , physiological and social problems .
Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .
I hope you understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .
After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed for no reason .
Ma .
2 .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets , so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him , in fact , she was so angry she could almost kill , but , she could n't because Pat was her best friend .
Unfortunately , we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre .
Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up .
I also like taking photographs , for example during my journeys or trips .
With best wishes , your student .
So , what are we going to do ?
Tuesdy 13th , June , 2000
Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE .
In my opinion , people 's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine , TV , cooker and the light , connected to the owner .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
There are also some older people who a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
I was very nervous talking with him .
So , that 's everything that I can tell you . I enjoyed it a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .
Because I did n't have any plan I decided to have lunch in the theatre restaurant .
It is understandable that once people have human implants , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced .
One day , I fell in love with my closest friend .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contribute to our scientific findings and research .
With product tags , children are given significant free space as compared to the restricted control of the implant .
I thought that Dany Brook , who is my favourite actor , would perform in that show .
And regarding the activities , I must choose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things .
The leakage of this confidential information can be a sensitive issue to people , a violation of freedom and breakdown of safety .
That should have been a secret for Francis - and they decided on the program and the present , a new gold watch .
However , in countries like China , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets , pets are usually left unchained and run freely in the streets .
For families , certainly , the burden on young people has become heavier .
The percentage of elderly is increasing annually according to United Nations ' projection .
Thank you for the letter you have sent recently .
MANUELA BELABARA
Someone could be injured .
It started at 20:15 , forty-five minutes late !
Last Monday , I went to the theatre with two friends .
Dear Sir ,
Azami
You could avoid this kind of problem if you look for big halls at the outset .
Dear Kim
I hope that my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival alone to young people .
I hope you write again soon .
Believe it or not , I put make-up on one famous singer 's face .
It is only 10 % of the time that the police successfully pinpoint the kidnappers ' den and arrest all of them before they start to harm the poor victim .
Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .
The significance of our existence is to lead a meaningful life and fight for the development of our world .
A long lifespan for the individual is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face a life full of problems .
Although some may appear again after a few years , different styles are developed .
When checking out , the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly .
Hello girl , how are you doing these days ?
Using this technology reasonably will assist people to walk faster and further along the long and rough path of developing civilization .
How is your new school and your parents ?
The new technology is changing our lives .
BUT THAT DAY , AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK , I DID N'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE . SO , WHEN I NOTICED IT , THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF , BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO .
I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely .
I am delighted to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all be paid for in advance .
Why did you not change the names on your advertisement ?
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems such as pollution , so we can live better and longer .
With the development of science and technology , surveillance technology is playing its role in people 's lives .
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she had done , but Pat refused to apologise to her , because she felt it was n't a mistake and she did it for only one reason : to help Maria to get the man that she loved .
I was very excited at the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it would .
The activities I would like to choose from the activity list are singing ( because I belong to a choir at school ) and photography .
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life . Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
Yours sincerely ,
On the other hand , the aging of the population can also be a challenge to the society .
Typically , RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip .
First , violation of privacy will be dramatically increased .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy leaded to nationwide hunger .
But anyway I like more to have the possibilities for to do climbing and surfing .
As I have explained , it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back for the reasons that I mentioned above .
However , when I got to the theatre , you not only did n't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical .
What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?
Second , modern technology helps me in the kitchen .
I am also used to writing exams which are very often in Polish schools .
However , human beings are not animals or any other product . They have their own thoughts and freedom .
People always queued for stuff from the west .
No matter what measures they take , population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
When the first car appeared , it was already a great success .
On the one hand , the Internet is often used for entertainment , but on the other hand it 's also used in different business and education processes .
Therefore , the usage of RFID chips more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required .
However , along with the increase of life expectancy , ageing problems have become more and more severe .
Therefore , surveillance technology can not be casually used .
Really interesting !
We can either step back to maintain the population with some method , or step forward to search for more resources in outer space .
Secondly , if you do n't mind , I would prefer to sleep in a tent .
Otherwise , it is just a waste of resources .
A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one has received .
Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
Yours sincerely
I 'm sure that in a couple of years we will see some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured .
Besides , when I bought the ticket , I found out there were not any discounts for tickets , while you wrote the contrary .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation .
However , the show started 45 minutes later .
I have got a doubt , it is not very important , but I would like to know if I need any money or if everything is paid for , the kind of clothes I should wear , if the weather is good or bad ... and all the extra information you can send me .
Dear Sir/madam ,
From that , I learnt more about the instruments .
One day my mother got a terrible disease .
As technology has developed faster and faster over 301 years , people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life .
If there are more young people , then there would be even more elderly with rising life expectancy in the future . If
Dear Sir ,
The shops have bad opening times .
From my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like leisure wear , sportswear , make-up , hairstyles , you know ...
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
As RFID has been used in transportation in the form of ez-link cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access of transportation needs has been seen over the years .
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of weather do you have in California ?
In conclusion , I want to say that in spite of this , I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will prevent our disasters and problems .
By keeping track of the suspects , police officers can decide exactly who the criminal is sooner and more easily learn the truth behind the crime .
Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines were used , people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandise in factories .
In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be used to track people .
Second of all , the play was supposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
Suddenly a murder takes place !
But data show the rise in life expectancy is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life .
In addition , field journeys are sometimes very dangerous .
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month ?
Dear Helen :
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME , ACCOMMODATION PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO .
In spite of the computer , children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer , but by parents themselves .
It sounds easy , just doing the lighting .
Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said `` ngratulations about for the new baby . ''
As far as the activities are concerned , I have chosen to do tennis and swimming .
They deserve to have a private life like any ordinary person .
I 'm not joking , I got his e-mail .
Yours sincerely
Surprisingly , there were no discounts .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also been used as a human implant or as a product .
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all of life , but it is only a little part of it .
However , people tend to express their personal feelings and ideas about sensitive issues on the Internet unintentionally .
As the amount of stress , the types of food mixed with chemicals , and the quality of living in terms of environment get worse .
I could n't believe it .
Shopping is not always enjoyable .
Internet can be a convenient source to find the name and basic information of people if the chip is hacked and tracking will facilitate the finding of designated persons . The
Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out in the streets .
While I was standing on the beach , suddenly I heard someone call my name and say that I had to go home . That is right , it was my mum .
Therefore , for the welfare of the ageing population , more old age hospitals will have to be built .
In conclusion , as I have mentioned above , we have to agree that tracking systems have many benefits in different aspects of human life , especially in this modern world .
The idea of democracy and power of the people will be at risk if people are tracked .
Everybody likes to be with their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around .
However , some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view when they object to implanting RFID into prisoners ' bodies .
Could you tell me approximately how much money I have to take for food , please ?
Two days later , when Pat came back to my school , she met Mr Harter , our head teacher , she told him everything about Ann1 .
I recently had a holiday in London and went to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
Thirdly , it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life .
You are interested in my last job !
Cheating could be very common in examinations and stealing would seldom incur punishment .

The show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched .
Therefore , some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
I know it was difficult and tiring but I enjoyed it a lot .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
On Monday morning , I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend .
Globally , manpower is lacking .
As life could be precious , An ageing population could be an advantage as well as a disadvantage to a particular country .
She was such a wonderful person in our class .
If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device , it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people .
In conclusion , based on the advantages and disadvantages discussed , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
The biggest commercial gain in history , I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
When I have such feelings , I feel that I do not belong to the human race like everyone else any longer ; instead , I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others .
EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS ( AND SPEND MONEY ) .
All these uses of surveillance technology makes the environment safer .
First of all , the actors were different from those who were advertised .
First , what clothes should I take with me ? Secondly ,
They form opinions and invent new fashion styles .
Thanks for your last letter ; I knew you would be interested in my experience of helping at the pop concert last time . Now I will tell you about it .
In addition , national defense will be endangered if this tracking proposal is launched .
13/6/2000-11-07
It has been shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
Dear Sir/Madam :
Although I was very nervous , I knew I could do the job well .
We could only buy things from Russia .
So if you do n't want to feel deceived or offended , think twice before you decide to go shopping .
It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hacking into the school software .
Dear Sir ,
On the other hand , people can atrophided of all these inventions .
This is what happened : when I arrived they told me that I was helping backstage with the scenery ; then the group arrived , we chat for like 15 minutes , then they had to go on stage .
It is an advantage , in terms of the intangible aspects , such as emotional and mental development of future generations and contribution to a country 's good reputation .
Some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing , that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
It is the way that " uses one stone to kill two birds " .
Obviously , rising life expectancy should also be considered as a serious challenge .
However , the fact is that such technology will create checkpoints everywhere .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive ; however , it is the benevolent nature of human beings that we treat pets as " human beings " , our friends , that we do not want to restrict their freedom .
She tried to help others when they had a difficult time at school .
Moreover , the theatre restaurant was closed with the word `` Staffvac vacation '' on the front door after the show .
When the show finally started I found out that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things that should be celebrated , one is red and one is white .
People are needed .
SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE .
FANCY GETTING TO KNOW THE FUTURE ?
Best regards !
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-quality food and even pursuing tasty and luxury food .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before humans took action .
Yours faithfully ,
RFID is used in many places for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
This form of RFID does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification in the emergency room .
And for the other one , I think painting will be a good idea ; painting is one of my hobbies and I 've been studying it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it when I have some free time .
It all started when one of the organizers asked me to help him at a concert of my favourite band .
For the second part , rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
However , whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authorities .
But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the `` , which will the London Fashion . Atthe s Show '' which 'll take place in Central Exhibition Hall , London , on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 and at the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show .
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it .
Perhaps the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety , but actually it conversely makes us less safe .
Secondly , it may be used by lawbreakers .
A suggestion ?
This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of workers towards the government , decreasing birth rates because people could not afford the expenses of their children 's upbringing and educational fees , which adds on more burdens and worries for the government .
It will be very interesting ...
Secondly , the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue .
I went out with him sometimes and we were happy .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harm to someone , people still prefer to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom .
Despite the fact she knew that Pat could n't keep a secret , this time she was confident that maybe she would be able to .
Lots of students normally have classes in the morning .
Otherwise , there would be more and more people staying on the street and destroying the good views of the Garden City .
The sun was shining and the wind was blowing like we had imagined .

With the development of modern society , people live longer .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduct money from their account and make a transfer of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Yours faithfully ,
First of all , I want to introduce myself .
It 's really amazing .
It is impossible to doubt that medical technology has improved day by day .
I am very well . I 'm writing to tell you about my experience with the pop concert last month .
For example , when I come back home from university and I call my friends , I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and a fax machine and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and things like that .
From the reasons above , we can see that surveillance technology brings great danger with it so that we can not apply it to our daily lives .
First , I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook playing his role , but he had never shown up that night .
Since inventory management is very important for some kinds of companies , this technology is playing a very significant role .
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes we have to bring .
With the existance of experience , we can do the work more quickly without sacrificing standards and quality .
I can find out what is happening in different parts of the world in a few minutes .
Therefore , when the era improves itself , disease does too .
To make matters worse , the time that the show started was delayed .
The electric systems short circuited with the result that the airplane was out of control and nosedived to the ground at extremely high speed .
With this letter I want to explain to you some problems I had last week at your theatre with your show .
In ancient times , due to the lower development of science and technology , people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care of the healthy .
We arrived on time but the show was delayed until half-past eight .
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote about in your letter , I am only good at climbing and sailing , because I used to do them with my father when I was a child .
I had to buy a £20 ticket .
It was unbelievable , and tiring as well .
He will be in prison for 5 years .
In addition , due to the tracking of people , the police can better know a person 's daily schedule .
In 1712 , Watt renovated the steam machine which increased the efficiency of the fuel .
Tips for earning money
However , while we are enjoying the fruits from the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing .
Nowadays , the improved technology online is able to track different locations for different people .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
Would you please return our money .
comparing the technology today and the past , we can see that a lot of diseases are treatable . The number of people who died because of diseases that are not treatable has decreased .
I could n't concentrate on the play any more .
Nowadays , we can make a phone call with an astonishing rapidity , whereas in my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to get in contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
I 'm writing to you in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival .
But it is not easy , because all are very interesting for me .
Medical expenses , and accommodation are the costs which directly involved old people .
Secondly , I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement because they have implemented healthy lifestyles and good eating habits .
On the camp I can practise them a lot .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
She entered the room , and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR !
I was just walking down by the dressing room and the manager asked if I could help them .
I phoned the police and told them the whole story .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
This is a great opportunity to learn something new because most of us have not been to this kind of show and it is free for students .
I heard them talking backstage .
During the year 2003 , surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation .
So the main rule in our school is regarding teachers .
I could n't go back to the class so I went home .
For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my life here in Greece .
The technology is growing and growing .
All of us would like to attend the show because young people , particularly girls , are interested in fashion and make-up , so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like .
I 'm not used to wasting my time sitting on a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .
The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , and a tape recorder .
Now I have to go . Write soon and let me know what you have been doing .
The children 's hearts would be shadowed and there is nothing we could do to make up for it .
An example of making an good informed decision is the story of planning and constructing a walking path . The government has a lack of information and decides that the people need a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a random location .
It may sound funny , but mud , gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight , so we change our shoes without questioning that rule .
Well I have to go now .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Anyway home is always the place to go because it is ours , we feel safe and comfortable there .
If there are fewer young people and more old people , as in both Singapore and China , when the elderly retire , there will not be enough young people who can fill the new available positions .
For example , intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices .
Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat your customers .
There is a Chinese saying that goes , " Jia you yi lao , ru you yi bao " .
In that case , they would have no choice but to seek the power of loyal police .
There is one more advantage : it is free for students .
It was incredible .
Second , the shortage of workers can also endanger the development of society .
Dear Helen ,
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sports shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .
Moreover , we were n't given any discount for being students .
As elderly people , they need more money for health care than younger people .
It 's like a joke , but a bit scary .
The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person .
I was there , I saw it .
In other words , the government originally hoped to use the tracking system to ensure citizen safety , now it has divulged human information .
Thanks very much , because is new stimulation for me .
We can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controls .
In conclusion , the increase in population age shows both the human technological achievement and new challenges like a smaller young generation .
Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie The
17th June 2000
I do not agree with this kind of behavior because humans are different from goods and can not be treated as goods .
After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there were n't enough drinks .
All have to work hard and cooperate to deal with these challenges as a way of meeting expectancies .
Even when disaster comes , we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time compared to before .
With regard to the date of the trip , July would be best because in June I 'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins .
For the whole society , rising life expectancy are a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
I once had this problem .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-paced life , this can be a double-edged sword .
Okay do n't wait , there where you 're good at and begin .
But we would like to suggest something to you : there is a trendy event about the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and hairstyles , on the 14th of March .
We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something else with the same purpose .
I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address .
All her friends were amazed at how she had changed and started trusting her at once .
!
The only time that it is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
In fact you try to get a present to make the recipient happy .
Besides tags in human bodies , there is also the issue of implants in products .
It is a break-through in technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
I was going to markets and to schools and I was giving out information about when and where the group was going to appear as well as where people could buy or book a ticket for this concert .
I am writing to complain about the show , `` Over , the Rainbow '' which I saw in your theatre last week .
A huge queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
You could also face an unpleasant situation connected with money .
Dear Sir/Madam The Circle Theatre manager
With the glory , there come problems .
No matter how good and how many security systems there are for us , the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security systems .
If you really want to hear about school rules in my country , I 'll try to write about them briefly .
This step will take a long time to research to make it possible .
There is a storm and they can not leave .
It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .
Ever imagine the day that no natural resources are left ? What would be the life of our next generation ?
What do you expect in the future ?
People 's lives are going from increasingly convenient to almost luxurious , thanks to the implementation of increasingly advanced technology available for man 's life .
Unfortunately we have noticed that on the 14th we are already visiting the Science Museum .
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW .
From my point of view , surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions .
Some concert halls were too small and often people could n't see the performances .
Maybe it would be better to put more of them in the programme because young people like them so much .
With the population ageing problem getting more and more serious all over the world , the shortage of various kinds of resources challenge most of the countries in the world .
In addition , now there is a contradiction in rising life expectancy ; it will lead to a resource problem .
I was very embarrassed and I wanted to run out of the class .
I attended your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions for it .
What should really be put under close surveillance is the government .
If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them .
On the other side , we have to say that the obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by rising life expectancy .
The reasons were mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , the lack of medicine .
I would like to do it again in the future .
Second , the show started at 20:15 , although I read that it would start at 19:30 !
It gives the police better control of the criminal .
Because of the surveillance technology , a lot of conventional ways or styles of human life could be changed .
I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter , our new classmate at school .
We are all extremely excited , especially because of the trip to Greenwich , the town we have always been interested in .
This gives credit to the Government 's medical and healthcare schemes .
But we never know !
To begin with , it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house .
You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much .
Another complaint is about the time that the show started . The advertisement said it started at 19:30 , but it did not . We had to wait 45 minutes .
Rising life expectancies could be seen as a good or a bad trend to others .
I would like to describe to you my experience because I want you to give me my money back .
I believe that the event was good . However , I feel that the festival could be improved next year .
Finally , the concert was exactly what the people were expecting .
I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre .
I do not agree with the above statement .
Even if I could meet some friend , I could n't express my heat to them because we have different backgrounds and our first languages were different .
I 'm allowed to do many things at home .
Imagine a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month .
They can be thrown away after wearing them and are light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change what you 're wearing .
It was absolutely fantastic .
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographs from .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement because it is evidence of progress in modern medical technology and it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of a too small workforce or too large population .
I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it .
It is undeniable that technology has made our lives and work easier and more efficient .
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling like , ,customer treat with order '' .
It would be great if you made a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show .
When there was an intermission we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late .
This tracking will help scientists to more easily get their results . Clear exploration route information will also be useful post-research when scientists come back .
Circle Theatre in London
Many science fiction authors have displayed good effort in describing a future in which everybody in society is put under close surveilliance by the government .
Another rising life expectancy is a bigger house with a lower price which is desired by the younger generation .
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husbands too .
The reason why life expectancy have risen is that we are becoming more and more clever due to evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Moreover , the band was exhausted by this great laser show in the end .
Rising life expectancy is also an achievement .
As a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
It allows us to maintain connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which have happened or will happen .
For example , they 'll wear clothing which protects them from air pollution , sunshine etc .
It was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion .
Helen Ryan
How has modern technology changed my daily life ?
However there are some problems that I hope to solve .
And what about money ?
Dear Principal , First of all , we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days ' stay in London .
Companies are in trouble if they can not earn sufficient money to sustain their business and they also need to pay high taxes to the government .
So I told her everything about my life .
After the concert I only helped tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .
Even if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find .
I had n't got my mobile phone with me and I was halfway between my school and home .
I think I 'm not bad at painting either ; at least everyone in my family likes my work , including myself .
13th June 2000
Yours faithfully ,
It was a fantastic experience .
If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes , they can hack into the government tracking system to do their own business .
This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all interested in clothes , sports and fashion .
This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent acts could be directed toward the one with the aid of tracking tags or implants .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new awareness . It will be a very positive point for opening up our lives .
When a person grows old , the medical needs of the person increase over the years relative to the age of the person .
For instance , in the military , which are of high importance , surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidence if anything is at fault .
Firstly , surveillance technology is useful in crime investigation and public issues .
Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .
By following the trend of improvement in technology , people can now be easily tracked by using RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) by simply implanting RFID tags in the human body .
So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting .
Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change to the programme : the star !
These changes and damages have also increased the chances of contacting more illness as we age .
Well , I think that is all .
However , they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves .
And that is what we are striving for .
Why do people like to go shopping so much ?
Also , please advise me regarding any things it is necessary to prepare and bring .
Some of us have been living in the same house since we were born .
So the dilemma occurs when there are more people who have a higher age .
THOUGH WE DONT HAVE SHOPPING AND FREE TIME .
In other words , there are more elderly who have lower productivity and more medical problems compared to younger people in the global population .
Not Being Imprisoned by Surveillance Technology
Actually , my mind has already gone there . I ca n't wait even for a minute .
Advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth is also a big challenge .
That is to say , population aging has aggravated the burden of society .
You ca n't imagine how much I enjoyed that journey .
In the first place , rising life expectancy could cause resource challenges .
When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to receive care from other people .
Dear Mrs Ryan
We would like to go in July , because my wife Catrin just have holidays next month .
And what do you think I answered ?
For this part , not only is the privacy problem , but also human health .
The government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
Therefore , this technology carries great risk if we can only see the advantages that have appeared .
I came second in last year 's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes .
I am going to stay here for a week .
The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .
One of the examples is the storage of bank account numbers in the tracking chips .
People should have to get a licence to drive those things .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of Victorian .
Thus , we should not compare now with the past because we need to worry about future problems that could be by this situation .
I have a really good friend , Pat who I trusted and counted on .
Parents can ensure the safety of children but not violate their privacy .
In a Chinese kindergarten , children could be always abused by a teacher but no one else would know it .
And years later it enabled me to get a very good job .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
After they are released from the prison , their movements are controlled and known by the government .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though .
We trusted him .
We can consider this scenario : the location of where we go in daily life will every second be sent to a computer to be processed and stored .
I would like to go only in July because I have had my holidays booked for that month since last January .
I hope to have a chance to practise both of them at 'Camp California ' .
We have become passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
Because the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-awareness , this system can prevent them from becoming lost .
One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams of for a lifetime .
This kind of job is perfect for young people who want to get money and at the same time have to study .
It happened 3 months ago , and during the last few months I have been very upset .
Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .
This ability was not seen 40 years ago when the technology advances were not as good as now .
Also , it was certain for me to be able to buy a discount ticket because I am a student .
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something that you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
It makes me a bit angry .
Probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there .
Love ,
All the students would be very grateful .
Dear Kim ,
During my 2 weeks ' holiday I wanted to attend a musical show .
It was totally different from your leaflet .
I was punished , nearly expelled , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Definitely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate it if it is possible to have my money back .
On the other hand what will happen to us in the future ?
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp .
At that time he was unconscious . I kept asking myself 'Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him .
Rising life expectancy is a challenge in the sense that it is highly reliant on the development of medicine .
Rising Life Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
Thirdly , we were astonished by the actors , whom we know from other musicals .
Parents give birth to children ; parents are responsible for taking good care of them .
I will give you all the necessary information .
Will we need any special clothes and how much would you suggest I bring for these two weeks ?
The last day , which was day of the concert , was absolutely fantastic .
Sometimes , they are happy to go shopping ,
But I was wondering , as a student of this college , if we could change part of this programme ... we 'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show .
If so , then why do we need human implants to trace activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like .
On the other hand , there were not sufficient materials or ways to improve people 's daily life .
You know ,
There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable , ' and who is happy only when he can go shopping .
Once such a chip is loaded with personal information and implanted in individuals , all the information about his or her life can be recorded .
About accommodation , I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are cleaner than the tents .
As you know I 'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do many more things apart from studying my A-level history , such as meeting up with my friends , visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own .
I was displeased from the very beginning , because I expected to get a discount as I 'm a student .
After the show finished I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
As you say in your advertisement , it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back .
But the most exciting part was meeting the band , mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good-looking .
In addition we would like to thank you for the programme .
Dear Mr Robertson ,
Therefore , the increase in life expectancy is also a great challenge .
Above all , population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of society .
In this paper , the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved through the discussion of violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authorities .
That evening , which should have been my perfect evening out , was in fact very tiring and boring .
So , we have the future in our hands !
WHEN THEY CLOSED , I TOOK THE NUMBER 7 BUS .
It was closed because of the staff training .
You might spend too much money and buy something you do n't really need .
Furthermore , I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fascination for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife .
YOURS SINCERELY ,
Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a camera ; otherwise , the teachers ' actions can not be supervised .
In last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
People in the current era are described as demanding or having high level of life expectancy in other words .
Maybe that is one reason for the decrease in the birth rate .
You offered something you could not possibly provide .
Because of the rate of environmental damage , we could see that the lifestyle of a normal human being has had to change .
First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only month when I will be able to go .
There is one thing in common in the worlds described in much fiction - chips are implanted in humans and record their location , history and even thoughts .
show the
Something that I note about technology is that we are losing green places and there is a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
We also have five computers , the latest models , because they are useful for my father to work on and for me to do some special projects for University .
This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Some socialists argue that using surveillance devices on people threatens human rights and should be totally abandoned .
However , as the population is ageing , challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workers also exist .
We have to think more about our future generations , be aware of the problems that increased lifespan has brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges .
I did n't have a computer until I was eight .
Just after Scala told her the news , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell her that Scala was pregnant .
Children play with computers instead of the usual toys .
Because I was doing it for the first time .
They will never have to leave the house or wake up so early .
I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future .
As the world is at the turning point of entering into a stage where people are constantly and notably older than before , there is a need to shed light on how to make life easier , more comfortable as well as healthier more healthier .
We are both a little worried . What kind of clothes and shoes do we have to take with us ?
This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people .
Dear Madam ,
Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that they are the one the same as the one on the ID cards .
Because of the fast growth of electrical technology , people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our lives to make full use of it .
I would like to travel to the camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
Finally you said there was a Restaurant , but it was closed , so we could n't eat anything until we got home .
It was a sunny Friday afternoon , Scala was really excited about telling her the news .
I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD .
Why did n't you say something about it ?
Judging from the crazy yet realistic anecdotes about gangsters , human traffickers , and the yukuza in his book , it is not difficult to imagine the opportunistic nature of human desiring this marvelous tracking technology .
provinces have gone along
Rising life expectancy can be a benefit to families .
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come from .
However , if the child has been implanted with a tracking device , more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back .
Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful , it still has to be used on a voluntary basis .
However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and all wish to attend .
We should n't allow the world to be exploited .
Dear Kim ,
Technology advancement is extremely fast nowadays .
The same situation is happening around the world .
And of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like .
I 've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it 'll be an exciting trip .
Furthermore , by showing the geographical position of people , RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of victims .
Pat , Maria 's best friend
In addition , could you advise me how much money I need for the trip ?
The concurrent result is the increasing size of the population .
As for surveillance technology , which is not only inefficient in improving our life quality but also violates our right of privacy , it should not be used to track people .
Surveillance technology : A prospering technology
Social networks such as Facebook,Tiwtter ,Twitter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without their knowledge .
I appreciate these shops for lots of products , cheap prices and big spaces .
In the late nineteenth century , a severe air crash occurred at Miami International airport .
Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you have n't noticed this before buying them , so you have to go back to the shop .
However , the aging population is the opposite phenomenon .
In this present time , surveillance technology has been developed which means that we are able to track people all the time everywhere .
But it 's life , destiny , very cruel destiny ...
Criminals could identify them easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved .
Please , if you would be so kind correct this mistake .
I do apologise for this .
You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price .
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help with changing the film rolls , cleaning the toilets or doing some other small jobs .
We know we are going for only three days , but we 'll have enough time to see one of the biggest cities in the world .
If society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but does not grant access to them for its senior citizens , it just does not help .
I 'm a beginner at both activities .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
I 'm sorry but I am very disappointed with the show .
First , food resources and medical resources are the most important to support living human beings .
Well here in Dublin things are still the same , but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point , which is the big venue for events and concerts . I guess it was the best concert I 've ever been to , but the coolest thing is that , well do you remember my friend Luke , the one that works as a security guard ? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage , so I went to help them and everything else , and when I got to the Point , do you know who was there ?
I would prefer staying in tents to log cabins .
I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were scheduled to do .
However , in this very non-ideal world where corruption is abundant , wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous , perverted and deadly weapon .
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won .
As for transportation , the roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
He was not DANNY BROOK .
We must accept that the media have an important effect on our lives , especially the T.V .
Secondly , surveillance technology can decrease illegal actions effectively .
So I 'm now writing to let you know how great it was .
The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of their species .
People are able to predict some disasters like and prevent them beforehand .
In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
More interestingly , this technology is being used in human identification , even planting the chip into the human body .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
Because I believed that this was a result which came about with my help .
If a country can bear an ageing population , it is a thing that the country can be proud of .
Actually , this technology is very useful and should be definitely go on being used .
Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible ?
Expansion of population can not continue like that because resources are limited , and we will end up dying out after using up all resources .
However , I 've found e-mail is better than those means of communication .
The aim of this report is to make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed .
However , as there are only limited space and resources on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all people worldwide .
I open my mailbox every night .
For instance , I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy . We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends ' graduation ( besides other reasons ) .
It became essential to doing my homework .
Do you think you 've got the future in your hands ?
Nevertheless , provision of more medicine and better equipment as well as more medical centres are necessary to accommodate the elderly .
Dear Mr. Robertson ,
Home sweet home .
I am waiting for a satisfactory answer
For example , the Internet has bridged the distance among people globally .
During the break time I did give a lot of directions to people who could n't find the toilet , and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee .
You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other .
In conclusion , the reason why population ageing is increasing majority is due to the great improvement of global medical science .
In a car accident caused by an official 's relative , the record was modified with a new record .
Medical advances which help in curing illness have also been getting better over the years which help in increasing life expectancy .
That will also cause more social concerns .
A tent will be cooler to sleep in than a cabin .
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochure .
It is very good for us but I think we should think more carefully when we buy something for our children .
We are sentimental and we have memories from the past .
The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes could be eliminated instead of increase .
It shows that , when all members of a group work hard together , you can achieve a lot .
When mentioning population ageing , the media always considers it a social problem .
I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before , she would n't have survived .
I only put the speakers in the right places , or helped the engineers test the lights .
In particular , the computer has changed my daily life dramatically .
So I decided to choose climbing and photography .
Dear Sir !
The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products has been noticed by people worldwide .
Dear Sir/Madam
Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals are the first steps .
IT SAID : 'DANNY BROOK ' .
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been replaced and the new one was n't good at all .
Firstly , it was a good break from the usual routine .
So I would like to get back our money .
For many , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings .
It was such a disappointment .
This is a great achievement made by a generation .
It is more like a prisoner 's life because we are under other people 's control and we can do nothing to change our situation .
Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
Advanced technology saves lots of lives which should never have come to this world or should pass away .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
For the first part , rising life expectancy is a challenge .
Thanks !
Furthermore , knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process .
Actually , not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling , RFID can keep human beings from harm .
In some fields , surveillance technology has brought us tremendous benefit and advantage .
31 Sea old State
Due to the increase of life span and the shrinking of birth rate , the number of elderly is becoming larger and larger .
Actually , I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident at it .
However , it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watches or clothes , even though it does provide convenience in certain situations .
For instance , Facebook , the well-known social media platform , has the ability to track someone 's location .
Shopping is also good when you know what you want .
Should I take some money with me ?
It is clear that population aging is happening all over the world , since the current average life span is 65 and the population above the age of 60 is increasing year after year .
Furthermore , in August I will be preparing for my course at the university where I am starting next September .
The ability to track every individual will empower dictators and their secret police .
After all , there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality .
As regards the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to do painting and photography .
This is the result of a better quality of life ; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitation and advanced healthcare .
For example , it could be installed in personal lockers to record other 's moves and actions .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Much media coverage has reported on the effective measures of installing the surveillance in Singapore .
Dear Sir/Madam :
Yours sincerely ,
In your last letter you asked me about the concert ... oh it was fantastic !
in July are hot .
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly person , and with the help of police officers , maybe they can find the elderly person , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country that has a population of about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
Population ageing : A more and more attention-getting topic
As our society develops , people have a much higher living standard , which will reduce the chance of getting disease .
You can not waste time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
As a result , the government needs more taxes from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people .
Another point is to go to a big area .
If there had been a camera in the classroom , maybe parents and the headmaster could have realized earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could have gotten protection earlier .
I am looking forward to your answer .
I had ever never sat down there .
I would prefer to stay in a tent because since I was a child I have been using this type of accommodation .
Yours sincerely ,
Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what it includes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governments to better manage the world that we are living .
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain ; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
which were unusual once .
Dear Mr ,
Yours sincerely ,
I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June .
On the other hand , shopping can be unenjoyable .
Billy Esposito
Then try to invent new energy and legitimately control the population birth rate , then developing medical treatment and paying enough attention , we have reasons to trust , population aging will not be a problem at all .
First of all because I have never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .
However , the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in invasion of privacy .
Because of CCTV , telephones and other RFID , we are becoming characters in a play watched by someone , but we seldom notice it and that is why it is horrible for us .
And they will use soft cozy fabrics like cotton and silk .
For individuals , since people 's life expectancy are becoming longer , there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California .
It may , in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately .
For example , a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method .
45-139 Warsaw
Sincerely yours
With population ageing and the increasing number of old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
Finally , please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring ?
During the less developed times , due to disasters like droughts , floods or severe contagious diseases like the Black Death , people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they did not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time .
My boyfriend was very handsome , clever and very polite .
But the thing that I particularly liked was that I could do all kinds of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions .
13th June 2000
I would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent , that 's , in my opinion , a way to be nearer the environment and the animals , although I do n't mind staying in log cabins .
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes , such as the latest fashions , leisure and sports wear , make-up and hairstyles etc .
How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping ?
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you have organised for our trip to London .
We could maybe change Tuesday 's programme to Wednesday .
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work . My current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August .
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping .
However , people who are responsible for assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and makes it easier for them to track suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively .
On the one hand technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier .
And my answer to the question about which activities I would like to choose , well I choose swimming , because it is my daily exercise , and surfing .
13/6/2000
I used to go camping .
While I 'm staying there I would like to practise tennis and basketball , as I have been playing both sports all my life , and I have to say that I am very good at both .
They were all sold out .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searches for people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
However , if the elderly person has been implanted with a RFID device , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device .
Among the staff you can also find young people and have fun with them during work .
Finally , I am wondering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need .
As technology increasingly advances , many of things that were regarded as impossible are becoming possible .
Unsurprisingly , none of them describe the future as a bright one .
I 'd prefer to stay in a log cabin because I need a proper place to stay and study in .
After your show I wanted to visit my friends , and because of it , I could n't do that .
Thank you very much for your letter . I was glad to get it and get a lot of news about you .
No discounts were available .
So we would like to suggest how the programme could be changed .
I 'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours !
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development in order to increase the capacity of our planet .
I was very hungry and tired .
I 've always loved music so working at a concert was great .
The more old people the country has , the more experience it will have as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and help them not make the same mistakes .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
On the other hand , rising life expectancy could bring some achievements .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thanks .
Juanita Fabiola Martin
IT IS VERY PLEASING TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA , WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may resist positive social change .
Maybe the reason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
We are building a new house for our family .
Dear Ms Helen Ryan
With increasing age , people become more prone to disease and injury , and have more difficulty recovering .
Firstly , security systems have improved in many areas such as on the school campus or at the workplace .
If this requirement is not fulfilled , this will lead to more financial strain such as increased taxes imposed on societal or company working groups .
Emilio Almodar , 18 years old , University Student , and the career I have chosen is in International Commerce or Market .
I would prefer a tent because I have never stayed in a tent before and I am wondering what it is going to be like . And from these activities I will choose basketball and swimming .
Dear Kim ,
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets . That was why our great plan for our holiday was not be real .
Thirdly , I am very interested in swimming and also climbing .
The activities I would like to do most are climbing and surfing .
It was a nightmare !
When I feel in the mood for shopping everything is closed or I have n't enough time to look around .
In front of the ATM , we need a camera to avoid intentional crime .
13th June 2000
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising .
THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IS GOING TO BE ON THE 14TH OF MARCH , FROM 10.00 TO 19.00 .
But not in any strange way you can imagine ... I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars into aeroplanes ...
Finally , could you tell me what I need to wear and also how much money I will spend ?
I would also like you to know about my two hobbies : swimming and surfing .
Finally , what kind of weather is waiting for us ?
Nowadays , people use the all-purpose smart phone for communicating .
Some years , there is a report on Hong Kong citizens ' living situation , in a small room there are eight people . They can not do anything in the room except sleep sleep and the air in the room is very bad .
I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is reserved for going with my parents to France .
Some people think RFID should be banned because of privacy considerations .
Actually , we can cure illnesses which were once very dangerous .
Yours Sincerely
Travelers survive in desert thanks to the GPS guiding them .
It presents a query : can everyone view each other 's information such as name and age ?
Can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget .
You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself .
Have a good time .
I had a week 's holiday in London , so I wanted to spend my last evening with great pleasure , however it was the worst evening in my life .
That sounds like we are naked in front of the public . There are no secrets or even privacy for us .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother .
First of all , technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
And unbelievably , I was responsible for looking after the pop stars .
!
These few problems were taking a toll on human life over the years after people were over 60 years of age .
I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving an allowance from the government , society 's balance has been broken .
What I most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures .
It was also written that there were discounts available and I asked about them and they said that they were n't allowed to give any discount .
With the development of society over the past thousands of years , technology has been progressing and concern for health is rising , so that higher life expectancy is achieved .
The children would tell their parents .
Rising life expectancy can bring us a more skilled workforce because we can delay the retirement time to extend the working years for each person .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL .
Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took .
These small things made the quality of people 's life less enjoyable than today .
Just imagine the future people 's way of life .
There are a lot of reasons why it can be awful to go shopping .
Rising life expectancies also indicates that the standard of living has improved for the majority of people .
PEOPLE WHO DO N'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR THIS SITUATION ( MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP ASSISTANT , BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE , HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS ) .
Secondly , the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15 .
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE WHOLE OF AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY .
Dear Mrs Ryan ,
I would like you to return my money because that was not same as your advertisement .
Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else they want !
I prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I am not used to narrow spaces and feel more comfortable with a place like a bedroom .
Secondly the language ability was another issue .
And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started .
I am writing to complain about the musical show ,
Therefore , the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary .
I think that the tracking can be saved in some place which is not open to public .
And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book !
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
You will see why I 'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read through my letter .
Surveillance technology could be used to detect very risky events and prevent them from happening in the future , hence saving more lives .
I would like you to refund some of my money .
From now on , I do n't want to tell Pat anything secret because she always tells someone else but she is still my best friend .
As a result , the worldwide now .
It was also very tiring because all the people arrived at the same time and they did n't want to wait for my help ; so they went around the theatre , looking for their seats and making so much noise .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
All I have to do is buy and choose .
Phukana Najee
Nowadays we have capitalism , free market , lots of private shops , markets and supermarkets .
All the work I needed to do was n't very interesting .
Their purchasing power is low .
Population ageing deemed to be an achievement when it first happened .
It made me so disappointed and angry .
13th June , 2000
EVEN THOUGH YOUR PROGRAMME IS PERFECT , WE WOULD PREFER TO GO THERE .
Yours sincerely
Because as soon as I send my message , they receive it .
Then we can see that rising life expectancy can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students .
I 'd read your advertisement and it did n't tell the truth .
In spite of that , the smart phone is still a device that needs to recharge its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object .
However , it is not easy to get a refund or to change them .
How could we appreciate the show properly .
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention .
First of all , I think that I helped them .
Surveillance is a useful method to keep society safe , but also affects the privacy of people in some degree .
For example when it is rainy , because then everything gets wet .
I hope you find my opinions useful .
My first question is about clothes ; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us ?
I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city .
She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge concert by a singer who is a well-known pop star as well as my favourite .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag ' enters a junction or a plaza full of people , police should notice this and observe the man 's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Ms MARIA AROZ
When he went back to his house , his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it was n't a surprise !
First of all I would like to thank you .
I really want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for elderly people ; it would be very pratitable if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies .
Write to me soon and take care .
All in all , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track the general population because of the violation of privacy , the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authorities .
Start some part-time foreign language classes for the students who are interested in them .
This means , having an elderly person at home is equivalent to having gold at home .
This is due to the improvements and breakthroughs in the realm of medicine and people 's living condition .
Pat found a great place for the party called `` Blue Box '' .
Every move is easily tracked .
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment .
And there are a few questions I would like to ask .
Perhaps , he moved to another town .
The first day consisted in surrounding the site with fences .
Hoping to hear from you
I 'm really good at taking pictures . It 's a way I have to express my feelings .
In conclusion , rising life expectancy can be considered both challenge and achievement .
On the one hand , if there are fewer young people and more old people , a smaller workforce problem will arise .
I decided to do something for this man . My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways .
I strongly believe that we will be in the best city and at the right time to appreciate it .
Secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble . After the show I could n't catch my train .
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DID N'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE CORNER OF MY STREET .
Thank you for your letter and your congratulations .
This already raises up the problem of privacy leakage .
For example , if the one who carries the identifiable sensor does not want others to know his or her location , he or she can disable the tracking .
As requested , I visited some classes during lessons and some other rooms while activities were taking place .
To make the matter worse , I had travelled to London to see this famous star but I did n't see any shows with him .
Competition Organiser
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings .
Every day when I open my door and go to the lady 's down the corridor , I am recorded by 3 CCTVs .
And now to win first prize !
So the population is getting more and more aged .
I often like buying gifts for my relatives and friends .
I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at university and at the moment I do not know the exact date .
Yours sincerely
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking through shelves and not finding that in the end .
Therefore , I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product would help the human race which also has been mentioned above .
The rising life expectancy globally can be challenging and yet an achievement because the problems of humans could be medically difficult .
The problem is that Pat works in Neubathin , a little village .
First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there were people only from six countries .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon as shown in China , India , Europe and other countries and regions .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement , but it poses more challenges to the government and people .
The real show is really very different to what is described in the advertisement .
People will be able to adjust and change with the times .
I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact were not available and I had to pay the normal price .
Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan .
Firstly , you spoke about two actors , Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produced around the globe .
Famous people are special in the eyes of the rest of society .
Even if I like to go shopping with some people and to some kinds of shops I will kill myself if I waste my time .
They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fees to maintain their health in a better condition .
With the help of video surveillance , the number of people committing crimes could decrease .
In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with , but do n't worry , soap is not very expensive .
Since RFID tags attached to a product can remain functional for a long period of time , they could be misused for surveillance purposes which are not related to industrial production or supply activities .
So , now my best friend is a prisoner .
I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible .
Definitely , I want my money back as soon as possible .
He or she could easily access the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers .
After the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this had n't been said before .
First it was because of the culture difference .
Otherwise , the comfort level of life will be maintained or lowered as time passes and people would have lower their expectation of life .
Dear Kim ,
If there is some controversy , how it can be improved ?
Even worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
Write to me soon .
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance , the possibility they would follow rules and orders is high .
Furthermore , to support themselves many senior citizens go back to work .
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement in the newspaper .
Second , it only started at 20:15 .
The increasing longevity is due to the fast development of society as well as stress .
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone , if you get lost somebody can find you .
The audience was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncers in front of the stage to stop people coming on the concert floor .
Most of the illness is associated with mental illness , musculoskeletal pain , and sight and hearing loss .
It 's like , ,walking in the clouds , , you feel like you are flying .
I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was 'Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour late .
In crime investigation , the truth of evidence is necessary , which can only be found in photos , videos or small tracks .
It is a disadvantage , on the other hand , in terms of tangible aspects mainly in the economic drive and desire of the nation for the sustainability of their economic position and reputation in the world .
Especially for families .
To raise life expectancy , one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medical system .
Basketball is the game which I love .
First I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do it in a hurry or as a duty .
It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that trades the children .
And of course , as you have seen , I 've given one to you .
Competition Organiser
JUST BE YOURSELF
In this essay , I will discuss surveillance technology , such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) , should be used or not used to track people .
It is unacceptable for some people in society . However , I think this application is necessary and provides society a lot of benefits .
Sometimes I think that people never grow up . If they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise !
I 'm really keen on sports , especially sailing .
Nowadays , humans live in a modern society .
ON THE WHOLE , CLOTHES WILL NOT CHANGE .
We have more researchers than a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution to lots of problems .
This is also an advance in surveillance technology .
I could n't believe my ears .
Secondly , I believe you should know that a lot of people , including me , were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small .
You said that it was a perfect evening out but it was n't like that .
I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another .
We can not deny that surveillance technology is a great achievement that secures us and protects us from criminals but we also can not ignore the loss of our privacy and even limits to our freedom .
Maybe the first impression is n't positive but , from my personal experience , I can say that this kind of job is fine for getting some money .
And I helped them fix the last details .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardware of the system , they do require software to function , which is ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
However , as far as I am concerned , using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration , rescues and police activities .
Fifty years ago people did n't even think that after 2000 years they would have another life .
I look forward to hearing from you .
In summary , rising life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for all human beings .
Your dance shows are very beautiful , the art exhibition is something original and exciting .
Francis discovered the secret !
If we have this technology , it will automatically confirm people 's identity and save the effort of carrying a lot of cards .
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .
You asked me few questions in your letter .
Valles Co. Cornel
Personally , I wanted to keep it secret because I was afraid that we might split up .
O. Labro
This report is aim to research the students about their daily life at school and give some suggestion about it .
If the show had been beautiful , I would have been quite happy to wait .
I 'm ok and let me tell you about my recent experience .
In spite of this , people should be aware that the power of science is not almighty , life will still go to the last page without revelation .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
A very good aspect of this change is that women have more freedom to work because before we had the technology they had to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave ovens .
Leon
yours sincerely
We know it is easier for those with a busy life .
People 's quality of life has been better now . In order to continue improving , people have begun to consider how to improve their life .
In the following paragraphs , I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion .
Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it .
If the current quality of life is sustained or increased in order to keep increasing life expectancy , it will continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
My life is changing too .
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A .
Moreover , after watching the show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant , but it was closed , it really disappointed me .
Therefore , I need to sleep in a bed .
Now about your questions , it is very difficult for me to give any advice about it . I do n't know your cousin very well so I do n't know what she prefers reading .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer the students the best way to spend their time without wasting time with silly places or events .
In addition , I would prefer to stay in a tent .
Polish supermarkets are not Polish-origin shops .
All of us hope to live in a freer , more relaxed and safer world .
Fourth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree there is a population ageing problem .
All the stuff for children is on the same level as their eyes .
The most important thing is that you choose the most suitable work for you wisely , according to the things you like to do .
I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer .
I thank you in advance and look forward to your reply .
Close surveillance creates not only the problem of unhappiness , but indicates also an unhealthy society .
Finally I met Pat .
You are sure to like it .
So , a longer life expectancy indicates how well people live .
It 's important to respect other people 's lives because it can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life .
Dear Jack
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP , PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED .
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as a member of the audience .
After so many children were abused , people would come to know the truth .
I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me for an address .
Then , we can go to the show during that period
And your last festival was very interesting too .
We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys .
We arrived at the theatre on time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .
I 'm writing to complain about the musical show `` Over the Rainbow '' .
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two-week trip to Camp California .
The contradiction between safety and privacy can not be reconciled perfectly .
First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor .
It should therefore not be used to track the population in order to protect people 's privacy and the idea of democracy .
It 's especially great to visit the Science Museum , because of its exhibitions .
Modern technology has changed my life .
Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later than I expected !
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
Having power can help people to achieve lots of things ; however , abusing will guide us another direction .
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER .
Where filial piety and respect for the elderly are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions , the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and also with their parents .
I advise you to do something like that .
I thought he was very rude , but I was wrong , he is n't arrogant at all and he looks very simply .
I also think that it will be a good idea to take some general plans of the school area as there is a huge background .
I think this festival is a great idea because it 's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art , but I also think there are some things that could be changed .
I am very happy to take part in the competition and I would like to give you all the information you need :
Although such rapidly advancing technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life ; it can also cause invisible or massive threats to our peaceful life that can be beyond our imagination and estimation .
Many young people do not view things like their parents used to do .
And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage .
Hence , rising life expectancy no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
As different kinds of fabrics will be invented and the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
We are all very happy with your programme , we especially like the idea of going sightseeing by ourselves and visiting the National Art Gallery .
What do they think about it ?
There are other machines which are bad for the environment .
Yours faithfully
Most things will be computerised .
I would also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is .
We have seen the programme and we all think it will be enjoyable .
For the first few days , Pat was with us all the time .
Shopping is not always enjoyable
I 'd love to hear all your news . Why do n't you come and visit me ?
In the novel 1984 , written by George Orwell , the author imagines a world in which people are being watched by Big Brother when they doing anything .
THEY DO N'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER ( SOMETIMES IT 'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE ) .
Have you ever seen the film star wars ?
Pat was very excited about this .
It is remarkable that the population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2 % to 3 % annually in developing countries as well .
Best wishes
I look forward to hearing from you .
I would prefer to stay in a tent so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around the camp .
Bye !
Would that be fine for you too ?
Imagine that one day , one is suddenly arrested by the police and told that he is accused of posting anti-society statements on the Internet .
The second one is that rising life expectancy can also be considered an achievement .
As a result of this our society has changed a lot .
I 've been sailing since an early age and I manage the rigging and sail perfectly .
This function can be used in many aspects .
They can maintain social control and recognize threats .
`` THE RIGHT PERSON ''
If pupils feel uncomfortable being watched by parents , citizens definitely would be unhappy being watched by big brother .
and is there anything else I have to know ?
The question you asked me in it is very original too .
Because sometimes the article being bought is not really necessary .
Firstly , I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic , but in your advertisement it said that I would find stars and artists from around the world , when , in fact , they were from only six countries .
Using surveillance technology such as Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) to track the population can be seen as merely progression from older technologies such as identification cards .
I want to thank you for this prize . Let me know if you need further information .
Yours sincerely ,
Please think about this and give us an answer .
This is the reason why I do not like shopping .
It can also be found in schools and workplaces .
( A very depressing point of view , is n't it ? )
WE THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY , BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW , WE DO N'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF SHOW IN THIS CITY .
Now I can tell you that it was an amazing challenge for me because I had never done anything like that .
Actually , tracking systems have provided people safety indemnification .
From the Internet and email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is an advancement for not only society but also the world 's achievements .
We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students .
We 'd like to thank you because this kind of event shows how dedicated you are to our school and the students that study there .
First of all , everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective .
At home I do n't have many rules either .
Trends of society and cultures can therefore be observed as a function of time .
Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
Furthermore , thanks to the development of technology , that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing , population ageing is accelerating and increasing .
It 's better not to write anything if it is n't true .
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and I would be greatful if you could give me back a part of my money .
Whereas , for the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
I 'm not sure if I can say whether technology has changed our life in a positive way or not .
13th June , 2000
Obviously , rising life expectancy is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospital technology , insurance condition , cultural development , and our social system , which shows the improvement of people 's quality of life .
Finally I just want to ask you what kind of clothes I have to bring with me , and approximately how much money do you think I will need ?
'How Has Modern Technology Changed My Daily Life ? '
In conclusion , surveillance technology is necessary in many public places , in my opinion , because we need it in crime investigation and social issues .
We could play with our toys , dolls and we could enjoy ourselves without a computer .
It not only restricts their freedom in all aspects , but also causes leakage of personal information .
Modern technology is better now than it used to be .
On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .
Dear Kim ,
In the modern world , many global issues have appeared like global warming , the concept of earth village and population .
Humankind is not an exception .
You ca n't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert . Apart from the musicians and the singers , there are people who work with lights , who organize the security ... it was so exciting !
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp .
The problem of abusing surveillance is actually a problem of abusing power .
Dear Sir
Yours sincerely ,
In supermarkets , where it is difficult to catch thieves , surveillance technology , which makes records that can be replayed or detects theives on the spot , is beneficial .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
Like in the zoo .
For the accommodation , I would prefer a tent because I like adventure and simplicity .
Surveillance technology , such as RFID ( radio-frequency identification ) , is one example that implemented .
First , our privacy is at threat .
But I have never 'surfed ' in my life , so that is an activity I have to learn .
It was a waste of time .
Studies have shown that life spans are getting longer which reflects rising life expectancy .
And I would like to make sure that he really loved me .
A computer might know more than a human , but there are many things which it can not replace in our life .
I would like to know if there are any washing machines or a place to wash our clothes .
I THANKED HIM VERY MUCH , AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO ME .
In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city , the County Council organised an open air concert .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means an increase in expenses and the advancement of society , including , at least , an advanced health care system , reduced hazards in the environment and ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
However , it has flaws which can be counter-used by criminals at the current level .
However developed our society is ,  technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes .
During the concert , I did n't have a lot to do , so I had a chance to see most of the performance . That was excellent .
There is only one thing different .
I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin , because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different .
Children could be easily tracked based on the location of their cell phones by their parents .
For example , the tsunami that hit Tohoku of Japan in 2011 was " the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II "
Yours sincerely ,
At the same time , our location should be protected from being seen by strangers .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
Firstly , population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology .
Firstly , privacy will not be protected if everything is under surveillance .
Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology .
The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which are brought by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies can not be simply discarded .
Of course there are a lot of other reasons why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last reason , which is very important for me , is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
I look forward to hearing from you .
All around people , the world is full of high technology like CCTVs , automatic sorting systems for goods and different information systems .
Then I 'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California .
This is very hazardous .
Ageing results in less manpower and fewer highly educated people are available in proportion .
Secondly , I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents .
AFTER FILLOWING HIM FOR 10 MINUTES , I STARTED TO RECOGNISE THE PLACE , AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
For these kinds of situations , RFID will help a lot .
In the movie , the spy agent accesses the public street cameras to track Jason 's Borne whereabouts .
It is therefore better to stick to the status quo .
Do you think we 're living like in olden times ?
In the night Francis was invited to the party , at Pat 's home .
Above all , I think we can not ban the use of RFID completely since it will be of great help during scientific exploration , rescue and police activities .
There are so many people in the FBI . Although it has strict rules , we can not think ideally . There could be one who abuses his power and accesses the resources for private purposes and leases them out .
They were giving two concerts , one on Friday and the other one on Saturday . They invited me to go on Friday .
Yet , do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement .
Now I would like to have your point of view .
It is the only time when I am free from my duties - I am a doctor so you see that I can not let my patients down .
Hence , once RFID is widely used , people are very likely to spy on each other , which will destroy trust , respect and many moral values .
In fact , this was the major limitation of people 's average life span in the past .
This will inversely improve the sales of the shop .
In ancient times , people may only live for 30 years ; but now , the life expectancy can be into the 80s in many countries .
With the development of modern society , more and more new technology has appeared and people 's quality of life has risen because of the new inventions .
Health care by far is the most expensive to carry out .
His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology .
The same goes for climbing . Do I need any special equipment and is it available in the Camp and what about the guide for these activities ?
Finally , everyone should slow down his own life 's rhythm .
I want to go there now .
How are you ?
I paid £ 50.00 for the show . I also have a receipt to prove it .
This was scheduled 3 months ago .
Dear Mrs. Helen
Here I am , writing to you to tell you everything about my wonderful experience at the concert .
My life now is recorded by lots of CCTV .
Lots of Love
Moreover , if the product is what one needs to use everyday like clothes or shoes , then the one 's location will be revealed every second .
After hard work , we want to go home to have our corner where we are able to rest and relax .
An ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being discussed in most of the developed countries .
We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon .
I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize .
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisement were not really true .
I had a great time that day .
Also , I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was crowded .
An ageing population requires more medical resources since the elderly needs more medical attention .
I 'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it 's the only month I can spend abroad this year .
In addition , corrupt officials may sell this tracking information to the mafia .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
Technology has developed increasingly in recent years .
Imagine when people camp in the forest or hills , they will lose all of the internet signal and also take the risk that their phone runs out of batteries .
With a low birth rate , Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country .
However , tracking people is difficult and different from goods .
I can stay at Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks .
Dear Kim ,
Another point where you could improve is if you show more plays and films next year .
I had to pay full price .
We have to say that older people are becoming a blackhole for the entire society in terms of manpower and resources .
These machines are connected to the Internet , and that gives my family too much access to all the information we want , from how to prepare a drink to what was the result of Sunday 's football match .
We can buy everything we imagine .
We have to admit that preventing the abuse of surveillance and using it reasonably depend on a sound legal system , and that means surveillance has its own restriction .
Modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot .
Finally , I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity .
WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SHOW .
As for your questions , I am free to travel only in July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer lifespan and consider it as an achievement .
I was so happy to hear that I have won a two-week holiday in the U.S.A .
Oh I forgot about something !
Nowadays , this technology has been used in many kinds of fields , such as transportation and logistics , transportation payment , product tracking and inventory systems , some institutions and so on .
Firstly , for scientific exploration , rescues and police activities , the privacy factors are far less important than individual or social safety and scientific results .
Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on this matter .
Then with technology we can reach any place in the world easily .
In addition , if RFID is supposed to be used by the public , everyone will be able to locate their friends and also their dearest family .
Yours faithfully
Yours sincerely
Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas .
I 'm looking forward to receiving your letter again .
Thanks for your attention .
I would be very grateful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year .
I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show .
First of all the Internet gives you access to a great number of different information .
However , as life expectancy has risen , some social challenges have occurred as well .
We would prefer the last two weeks in July .
In the modern digital world , electronic products are widely used in daily life such as smart phones , computers and etc .
If looking after children does n't suit you , you can try the same thing with pets .
I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny !
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fight against SARS , and this is a successful example of surveillance .
I told her everything about my boyfriend and when we met each other and eventually fell in love .
I look forward to hearing from you
However , because of civil rights and privacy , surveillance technology such as RFID (  radio-frequency identification ) should not be used to track people .
I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago .
And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .
Firstly , I had no discount when I paid .
All the time , I am thinking about Peter .
That was a bit boring , but it was part of my job .
If the number of old people is too large and there is a smaller number of younger people , it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are fewer , and the productivity and technological improvements will be fewer .
Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what happened in the past .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
Therefore , the theatre or the company is lying .
Now , about the tickets , there were different prices but there were no discounts , and because of this , many people could not see the show , especially students .
Moreover , when we allow surveillance technology to be used to track people , it increases the success rate of people committing crimes .
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you to organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday .
A couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend , who is into music , and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing .
Moreover , the advanced technologies have helped people to overcome different natural disasters .
However , it is an achievement as it is an indication that our society is progressing well and people are living in better conditions .
Secondly , the show started one hour and fifteen minutes late .
The only time for me to visit you is July .
I think for all of us home is something which is very important .
Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding to it are arising .
I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happens .
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July , due to problems beyond my control .
This phenomenon is accepted by the public , even by those who do not own a pet .
Moreover , I could not go to the theatre restaurant because , by the time the show had finished , it had already closed .
I love swimming , but I am not any good at swimming .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would not be sufficient medical resources for usage .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa .
When not using it , just switch off the card , then it will be just a useless piece of .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Alvaro Ramirez

Population ageing is a global phenomenon that has arisen in both developed and developing countries .
When the technology is not so well developed , it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information .
Is there a chance to stay in a log cabin .
In the past , when people were injured or became sick , there was no guarantee that the people would get good treatment and fully recover ; therefore , people could easily die if infected with a minor disease .
Without all this technology we may need to live in the same conditions of centuries ago , with a higher death rate when diseases spread around the world and the human nations had no solution .
A traditional way to earn money , in your spare time , is to deliver newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
In developed countries like Japan and Switzerland , life expectancy can be more than 80 .
And the main reason why our family is so friendly is because we have n't got many rules .
However , this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons .
For example , when people go somewhere , no matter taking bus , MRT or driving , they are on CCTVs .
Avoiding corruption and decentralizing power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
Not long ago SARS , as blurry a memory as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Meanwhile , these activities are develop .
THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER .
The star , the actor Danny Brook , was n't in the musical show but there was another actor , to my great disappointment .
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it 's the month he can give me one , so I hope that is n't a problem for you .
People need a safe environment to live in , and also need a private environment to stay independent .
Also tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice a week with my friends .
It is experience over .
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
The rising life expectancy shows the human nation has overcome some of the challenges of the natural environment around us during the existence of so many centuries ; therefore , it is an achievement .
Although surveillance technology should not be totally abandoned , regulations of using it are expected .
Less money will be left to develop the country and explore new areas of business .
One day I decided to tell my best friend - Pat , who I relied on .
They pull up the age to retire .
A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world .
I could n't really do much , so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs .
I ran back home for help .
Furthermore , the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us .
The fast development of medicine and technological products has made people 's lives much healthier compared to the past .
ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or stories written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories who lived longer than 80 years old .
You have to read it yourself .
This form can also be used as a tracking device because the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
He did not like this habit and had thought it was bad of him until he solved a big crime .
The biggest difference between humans and animals or any other object is that we have self-esteem and we need basic respect from our peers .
I have chosen as my activities surfing and photography .
Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to get information , for example about travelling .
There exist various advantages of using surveillance technology .
I look forward to hearing from you .
It can provide a safe , convenient environment .
I was promised that after the show I could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late , therefore , when I went to the restaurant they were definitely closed .
The increase in population means that more natural resources are needed and people have to think of some ideas like to prevent using too many natural resources .
The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret .
All of these are human achievements in their own right that have resulted in rising life expectancy , and hence they also illustrate why rising life expectancy can be considered an achievement .
The economy of country is boosted and could further lead to new development and raise our standard of living .
It is useful to the government and people in the law sector .
However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .
Every day , something changes and we become more modern . Companies use computers instead of books , dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers . Even homes are affected .
And swimming is very good for their health .
Paya Chuaswee ( Miss )
All technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons .
However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .
Dear Mr Robertson
I 'm writing to you to tell you about my experience helping at a pop concert last month .
Yes ! ! !
In my opinion , the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement .
Anyway the people who asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes too much work .
The first challenge is the decreasing number of .
So surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
This fact is very controversial among people and the possibility of personal information being released knowledge also causes public concern .
I was in her room helping her .
Our lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us at work .
And all of it is free . According to your programme , we have the Science Museum which is in the morning and then shopping .
Some may use it to peek or record something illegal .
That is to say , we can use it in some specific and special areas such as public security and politics .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization can not match our material aspect , old people will have tough twilight years .
The challenge will be increasing the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
With an ageing population , many countries are facing the same challenges to build safe houses and facilities to cater to the old aged .
What more do you want ?
Anyway , there are some questions I 'd like to ask you : what kind of clothes would be the most suitable for California weather in summer , and how much money do you think I 'll need ?
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list .
There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective , and he finally solves the mystery .
Yours faithfully ,
I can really recommend this book to you . It is fabulous .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Yours sincerely ,
Korea is an example .
In conclusion , RFID benefits people more than brings harmful side effects to the human body when considering human safety .
Maria was speechless , it was the first time that she did n't know what to do , so she decided to stop talking to Pat .
Everything was set ... the day and hour came .
But I could n't shut my mouth . I continued : `` You ca n't believe , P it Pat a man . , she wears trousers like men g forha flowery blouses '' Of course , my friend and I were laughing during half an hour .
I 'm fine .
Scala was angry with Pat because she thought she could keep this kind of secret .
In addition , I think you also have to take plans from the school 's nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children , and the parents can see that the teachers are very good .
Even applications in our Iphones or other smartphones , or our I-pads can easily reveal our location .
Sincerely ,
Thanks very much .
She was a very pretty and kind girl , but she had this bad habit .
That means when the child grows up , he or she needs to take care of both parents .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they do not even need to bring any money along with them .
I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
I also thank you for the excellent idea of having one ticket for all events , which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in .
I will only be able to set off in July and also I will give my thesis to my teacher in August .
In , the not very distant , 1914 , parents sent their sons to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
Fashion of the Future .
There is also one thing that I would like to ask you about .
This was not imaginable during less developed times .
I would like to travel in July for two reasons . One 's because I will have finished my exams by that time and the other is that in the first two weeks of that month I will go to Farnborought is special 10 days the presentation the Air show and the delegation from my country will be there .
For example , there are always reports in the newspaper about some elderly people who get lost at certain places and their families are looking for them .
Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk .
In my opinion , I think we should study balance as well . On one side , we should continue to make efforts to improve the human life . On the other side , we should consider using asking some sick old men whether they want to take euthanasia .
Moreover , as shown in many Hollywood movies , Google mail is also accessible to the FBI .
In addition , it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
Secondly , I am interested in trying something that I have never done , so I would like to do sailing .
I have questions too .
We often put tags on products and animals . Because we treat them as goods , it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged .
Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
Also , you wrote about discounts , but it was not true !
Without surveillance technology , suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder could be much more serious if the police could not arrive in time to help out .
13th June 2000
Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave .
Because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and everyday comforts , during these two weeks .
Subject : About daily life at our school
From these points , we should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment .
Jazz , rock and classical concerts are amazing , but I think that some concert halls are too small , so not everybody can come .
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT 'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SIT AT HOME , CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER .
IN ADDITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET .
Dear Kim ,
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in this field .
You should have said there were very few .
On the one hand , nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return on the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
The first example will be to track your personal items and avoid losing them .
I 'm so sorry I have n't written until now , but you know I 'm always very busy .
As we are humans , who are different from other animals , we have some basic rights like the right to privacy , the right to life , the right to have a family and so on .
I went to your show called `` Over The Rainbow '' and I was ly disappointedin many po ppointing bymany po things . points .
I hope they call me soon . I 'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again ...
These two are easy to connect , I could climb and make pictures at the same time .
So rising life expectancy will make the world population larger and more people would share the limited resources .
Moreover , I was shocked by the reason for which it had been closed : the chef left after he received a phone call !
Overall , the benefits of this technology outweighs its problems if people use it wisely .
And at the same time , these old people take up a larger portion of resources and budget of this society .
In a social science report last year , this number could further increase to 90 years old in the 2080s due to advanced medical technology and better living standards .
13/06/00
I really want to tell you all about my experience .
Definitely , we should perform these necessary duties very responsibly and carefully .
We can not imagine our every move being tracked and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through a monitor .
However , I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement .
This can increase the efficiency of solving crimes and thus decreasing the number of criminal acts or people .
My friend and I made the perfect decorations with balloons and other party stuff .
On the other hand , science is changing .
At precisely that moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter 's niece .
This is just to let you know with whom I worked .
Yours faithfully ,
If surveillance technology is abandoned , the police would have would have more difficulty tracking suspicious people and could have little control of the people who are dangerous to society .
I must say that was great fun . I 'd never had this kind of experience before .
While we are celebrating break-throughs on our way to Utopia , we are facing a new challenge .
Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them .
They were just playing and , by accident , Peter shot him .
The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with a large population , but due to the " only child " policy , we will have no benefits from a large population in the future .
So I did n't have such a perfect evening as was promised in your advertisement .
In that sense , rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement .
At the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
I am looking forward to hearing from you .
I mean , almost everyone now has a car , a computer , a mobile phone and even an airplane .
